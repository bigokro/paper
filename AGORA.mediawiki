=The Canonical Debate.=
A proposal to fix the current state of online discussions and debate, brought to you by the [http://democracy.earth Democracy Earth Foundation].

==i. Abstract.==

Thomas Jefferson once said, "The cornerstone of democracy rests on the foundation of an educated electorate." We are living in the Internet Era, where information should be more available and abundant than ever, and yet it has also been said that we are now living in an era of "Post-Truth." We at The [http://democracy.earth Democracy Earth Foundation] believe it is time to take the power away from the hands of elected representatives, and place it finally where it belongs, in the hands of the public. However, in order for this to be successful, we must ensure that the citizens of the world have all the information they need to make the right choices for themselves, and to make sure that this information has been validated to the maximum extent possible. Although some may say that the Internet is "broken", we believe that the problem is a structural one, and thus one that can be fixed. In this white paper, we define what we believe to be the missing piece to the Internet: an "agora", a place online where individuals with different opinions can come together, rather than apart, to debate and discuss openly and constructively the issues that face them, to propose solutions for these problems, analyze the trade offs and choose the one that best suits their needs. This tool reverses many of the natural incentives of other social networks that have led to information bubbles, clickbait headlines, sensationalist journalism, and "fake news." We believe that with this tool, we can finally fulfill the promise that was given with the rise of the Internet.

==ii. Contents.==

This document describes our vision for online debates and decision making in several parts, first from a conceptual and philosophical level, followed by a detailed description of our proposed solution for this vision:

* [[#Problems|Problems]]: Provides an overview of the current state of debate and discourse online, and where we see a need for improvement.

* [[#Manifesto|Manifesto]]: The fundamental principles upon which our solution is built.

* [[#Paper|Paper]]: Our proposal for a new platform upon which intelligent decisions can be constructed in collaboration with one another.

We do not intend this text to remain fixed. It is published under an open source license and we welcome contributions from anyone, as our goal is for this document to be a living roadmap for planetary governance. Democracy as the ability to trust each other to the greatest possible extent is a defining force shaping the trajectory of history. Our mission echoes urgently across the globe, encompassing all of humanity: the need to make our shared home a place of peaceful coexistence. The [http://democracy.earth Democracy Earth Foundation] has performed [[#Background|extensive research]] on voting systems, cyberpolitics and blockchain networks; we stand at the forefront of a public conversation regarding the internet as a planetary jurisdiction.

===1.2 The Problem With Debate.===

In the first 2016 presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Republican candidate Donald Trump, <give an example>.

A Breitbart article on the problems with immigration said X. However, a separate article on Y said something totally different. Finally, a personal discussion I had on Facebook went like this.

These are serious questions, ones which are currently being discussed by milions, changing the fates of nations, resulting in the spending of billions of dollars, in families being separated, people being harmed, others being denied basic services, or jobs. There are millions of people dedicating a large part of their lives, professionally or otherwise, to studying these issues, participating in actions to try and make a difference. A small portion of these millions know a great deal more, or care a great deal more, than the majority. Why is it that in each of the examples provided above, it was only possible to scratch the surface of the problem, to disagree so much on substance, and not come to a consensus?

It is not 

Imagine if you never had to repeat an argument. Imagine if no one ever had to repeat an argument. Once a point was made, it stayed made. Think about the arguments you've had with other people over politics. How many of those things you said were things you had read elsewhere, or heard from someone else? How many of those arguments you made were BETTER than the original argument? Did you have more or worse information to back your point than the people that originally said it?

Meat production is bad for the environment.
How bad? How do you know? Did you see it in a documentary? Did you read it in a news story?
Did that source have more or less information than you do now? More? Then why is it that YOU are the one making the point now?

How many times have you been in a conversation with someone and realize you need to look something up? How many times have you gone to Wikipedia? How well did that work for you?

<div id="Manifesto"></div>

==1. Manifesto.==

<blockquote>
  Democracy is always a work in progress, it’s never an absolute idea or it would otherwise be a totalitarian ideology just like all the rest of them.
</blockquote>
'''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mujica José Mujica]''', President of Uruguay (2010–2015).

a fundamental concept behind making THE debate site is that “you never have to repeat an argument"
that is, public discussion never seems to go anywhere because claims and counterclaims are made over and over again between different parties, and the amount of information is never consistent.
our knowledge doesn’t ACCUMULATE - instead, we handle debates like they’re some kind of game of “telephone”, where each person repeats what they heard to the next person, but with less context, less information, and only some of the original arguments
In order to end this style of debate, we need one central, CANONICAL source for claims and arguments
then, when someone makes an offhanded comment in Twitter or FB, (like “A UBI could eliminate competition and thus diminish progress in a variety of areas”) instead of it being superficial, you would know it was backed by all the data the world could provide up to now.

-- Creating a collective memory

2) This is actually related to the first issue, but: How can anyone fully trust a company that needs to make money to host THE site that holds all our political opinions
I thought about launching this idea as a private company at one point (a guy’s gotta pay bills, right?), and came to a horrifying conclusion:
we’re already afraid that Facebook has too much power, and all we give it are likes
imagine a private company where we cast actual votes and contribute arguments to a central debate that affects humanity. How much could you sell that for?

Worse, how long until someone starts accusing the company of weighting the odds in favor of one candidate over another? Of promoting the debates it thinks are important over the others? And so on. And who’s to say the accusations are wrong??

Principles:
* The strength of the argumenter needs to be removed from the arguments
* Emotion is for motivation; logic is for decisions
* Knowledge should accumulate - don't repeat arguments
* There is no right answer - only trade offs
* When you have all the facts, what remains are beliefs, values and trade offs
  - Because of this, decisions can never be made by a purely logical machine
* Decisions can and should be revisited as knowledge changes
* Everyone, even trolls, have a point that should be discussed... constructively
* Debates bring people together, rather than pulling them apart
  - The one natural place opposites come together
* Protect the identity of individuals so they can propose unpopular arguments and vote safely according to their beliefs
* There are many known human biases and cognitive dissonance in human reasoning. People need to learn about these and how to identify them
* People need to learn what makes for a good argument
* You can't force people to eat their greens - you have to use honey (you have to design the system to match human wants, needs and thinking)
* A short statement is only weak if it stands alone. 

We believe the solution should be:

* Fully transparent in terms of debate history and curation
* Free from commercial interests
* Decentralized
* Open to everyone
* Canonical
* Curated
* Provide ways for people to see the world from another's perspective (Be a tool to help people understand one another)
* Allow people to declare their own beliefs, even when in the minority
  - Provide tools for people to understand themselves
  - Highlight when there is an apparently inconsistency in the way they vote
* Anchored in context (how many times have we seen people moving the goalpost in the middle of a debate?)
* Anonymous voting
* Secure (from hacking, from Sybils, etc.)
* Evidence-based
* It should be possible to grasp the principle arguments of a debate in 30 seconds or less
* A short statement is only weak if it stands alone. Our solution gives them giants on which to stand.
* Teach people how to argue well

Side benefits:

* May change journalism as it reverses incentives: emphasis on quality original sourcing and fact-checking
* Once successful, "fake news" will die (people will be too used to checking statements. Tools can automate these checks.

===1.2 Geopolitics.===

A consequence of the US Presidential Election of 2016 is that the [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/16/qa-russian-hackers-vladimir-putin-donald-trump-us-presidential-election fear of foreign intervention] has become a leading threat to the security of electoral processes. But although voting machines are an extremely vulnerable target, ([https://blog.horner.tj/post/hacking-voting-machines-def-con-25 defcon 25 had a large selection of voting machines, all of them were exploited]) foreign attacks have a simpler method than hijacking voting machines because directly manipulating votes potentially can be traced, is very expensive, and difficult to execute on a scale large enough to satisfy an attacker. A more efficient approach is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack instilling public fear by collapsing internet infrastructure days prior to an election] in a way that can help push favoritism on a candidate that is perceived stronger than the other one. This kind of cyberattack able to trigger a shift in voter perception is nearly impossible to trace as political subversion and reveals the inherent conflict that a digital commons has with territorial democracies.

With this diagnosis, in [[#Paper|Section 2]] we map the basic building blocks for a decentralized liquid democracy. Once the tools are defined, [[#Execution|Section 3]] proposes an implementation that focuses on making the system secure and inclusive.

<blockquote>
  It is the technology that we do not control the one that is used to control us.
</blockquote>
[https://twitter.com/earlkman '''Emiliano Kargieman'''], space hacker (1975).

The solution is to build the missing piece to the internet. The problem is a structural one. But it is possible to build a fix, one that can change the way people interact. There are several examples of this. Think how the world was before and after each of these pieces were added:

* Google
* Wikipedia
* Text messaging
* Twitter
* Facebook

None of these pieces have fulfilled the "promise of the internet", but they have radically changed the way we interact, for better or worse. What, then, is needed to fulfill that promise?



<blockquote>
  We do not call upon ordinary untrained citizens to perform surgery, fly airplanes, design computers, or carry out the other myriad tasks needed to keep society functioning, what makes governance different? The problem is readily understood: if we give governance to “experts” they will make decisions in their own best interests, not in the best interests of us all.
</blockquote>

===2.1 Token.===

An ideal voting system must be able to satisfy to the greatest possible extent these conditions:

* '''Secrecy''': voter must be able to cast vote in secret.

* '''Verifiability''': voter must be able to verify tallied vote.

* '''Integrity''': system must be able to verify correct vote tally.

Additionally, due to the risk that coercion through physical violence or threats in contexts prone to political violence, an option able to protect coerced voters must be introduced:

* '''Resistance''': voter must be able to override own vote if necessary.

In the work led by researchers Hosp & Vora, an [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/24d5/5c866a7317dae11d37518b312ee460bc33d3.pdf Information Theory approach was taken to model voting systems] leading to the conclusion that a natural tension exists with a system aiming for ''perfect integrity'', ''perfect ballot secrecy'' and ''perfect tally verifiability''. All three cannot be simultaneously achieved when an adversary is computationally unbounded, able to brute force a system if unlimited time or memory are available. For this reason we consider it indispensable to implement digital democracies using blockchains. With network effects already in place, blockchains are able to verify transaction integrity and prevent token double-spending. Bitcoin’s [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system ''proof of work''] model achieves this by rewarding computational capacity verifying transaction blocks (what is often referred as ''mining''), leading to a network “300 times more powerful than Google’s resources” according to pioneer [http://twitter.com/balajis Balaji Srinivasan]. For this reason, our design is based on tokens within a blockchain network operating as ''political cryptocurrency''.

What differentiates a vote from money (or in broader terms: a ''political economy'' from a ''financial economy'') is that political currency is designed to guarantee participating rights under fair conditions to all members within an organization. Rights aim to satisfy overall legitimacy in the governance of an institution. While money is the language of self-interest, votes express the shared views of a community. Political currency is not strictly meant for trade but for social choice.

====2.1.1 Implementation.====

Considering that value [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogecoin can be driven by memetic capacity], the Democracy Earth token granting voting rights will be branded with the single most important message any democracy can convey: ''vote''.

The ''vote'' token can be implemented using smart contract code across a variety of blockchains that permit [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness Turing Complete] scripts, including Bitcoin. Our design is blockchain agnostic in recognition of a computer science field still in its infancy where significant innovations remain to be invented. Nonetheless we are working on implementing the ''vote'' token under these smart contract environments:

* '''Ethereum''': Using a set of [https://github.com/ethereum/solidity Solidity] smart contracts under the [https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard Ethereum ERC20 token standard].

** '''Rootstock''': We are taking the necessary steps to make Solidity code compatible with [http://www.rsk.co/ Rootstock's smart contract interpreter for the Bitcoin blockchain].

* '''Lightning''': With the activation of [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Segregated_Witness segregated witness] in the Bitcoin protocol that enables routing of payment channels with the [http://lightning.network Lightning Network protocol], liquid democracy delegations can be mapped using satoshi-level transactions carrying an attached ''vote'' identifier. Blockchain settlement cost must be covered by the implementing organization.

Also, multi-chain implementations are encouraged in the spirit of seeking greater experimentation and collaboration regarding these technologies.

===2.2 Voting.===

The ''vote'' token aims to be a standard for digital democracy able to interoperate with other tokens, setting a common language for the governance of blockchain based organizations. Within the context of liquid democracies, a range of voting transactions is permitted with ''votes'':

* '''Direct Vote''': Selfish voter Alice is allowed to use her tokens to vote directly on issues as in a direct democracy.

* '''Basic Delegation''': Alice may delegate ''votes'' to Bob. As long as Bob has access to those tokens he can use them to vote on Alice's behalf.

* '''Tag Limited Delegation''': Alice may delegate ''votes'' to Charlie under the specified condition that he can only use these tokens on issues carrying a specific tag. If the delegation specifies that delegated ''votes'' can only be used on decisions with the ''#environment'' tag, then Charlie won't be able to use these anywhere else but on those specific issues. This leads to a representation model not based on territory but on knowledge.

* '''Transitive Delegation''': If Bob received ''votes'' from Alice, he can then delegate these to Frank. This generates a chain of delegations that helps empower specific players within a community. If Alice does not desire to have third parties receiving the votes she delegated to Bob, she can turn off the transitive setting on the delegation contract. Circular delegations (e.g. Alice receiving the tokens she sent Bob from Frank) are prohibited since the original allocation of ''votes'' from an organization to its members carries a signature indicating who is the sovereign owner of the ''votes''.

* '''Overriding Vote''': If Bob already used the delegated ''votes'' he received from Alice but she has a different opinion on a given issue, as the sovereign owner of her votes Alice can always override Bob's decision. Voters always have the final word on any given decision with their original ''votes''.

* '''Public Vote''': Often referred as the ''golden rule'' of liquid democracies, all delegators have the right to know how their delegate has voted on any given issue with their ''votes''. In the same way congressmen votes are public, on liquid democracies competing delegates on any given tag have an incentive to build a public reputation based on their voting record in order to attract more delegations.

* '''Secret Vote''': A method able to guarantee ''vote'' transactions untraceable to the voter. This is indispensable in contexts of public elections held within large populations that have a high risk of coercion. Even if perfect secrecy on ''vote'' transaction is achieved, users can still be fingerprinted with exposed meta-data. For this reason, research on integration with blockchains designed for anonymous transactions with a proven track record is encouraged. This might include a mining fee to settle the ''vote'' transaction that can be either subsidized by the implementing organization or directly paid by voters. We recommend research and integration of secret ''votes'' with these blockchains:

** [https://z.cash ZCash]: implements shielded transactions using [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof zero-knowledge proofs]

** [https://getmonero.org Monero]: uses [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_signature ring signatures with stealth addresses].

===2.3 User Experience.===

User Experience (UX) is a critical aspect of a decentralized architecture and becomes even more important as the redundant layers of centralized architectures condense to the user. In a centralized internet architecture, the user does not own the interface or experience. In a decentralized internet architecture, the user interface (UI) should be based on the user's perspective. In this sense, transactions get done under three distinct views:

* '''Self''': Using a public identity related to an individual.

* '''Organization''': In representation of an organization that extended representation rights to individuals (e.g. workplace, club, political party, etc).

* '''Anonymous''': Without any connection to a public identity.

This understanding of ''SELF / ORG / ANON'' shape-shifting requirement highly influenced our interface and token design. At any given time a Sovereign user can adopt any of these modes to interact with decentralized organizations.

====2.3.1 Liquid.====

Sovereign aims to make liquid voting immediate and simple. Any friction in the process must be avoided and the delegation widget should be constantly exposed on the interface while browsing issues or looking at member profiles. For this purpose, Sovereign uses a ''liquid bar'' that permits transacting ''votes'' with a single gesture either on mobile or desktop devices.

[[File:/images/liquid-mobile-ux.png|Sovereign mobile interface displaying decision, ballot and liquid voting.]]

The ''liquid bar'' allows these actions:

* '''See available ''votes''''': Since in a liquid democracy a user can have 1 or more delegated ''votes'', having a constant reminder of the balance helps the user understand his or her current power within the system. If some of the ''votes'' were delegated with strict conditions (e.g. a ''Tag Limited Delegation''), this means that a user won't have the same amount of ''votes'' available to spend on every issue.

* '''See cast ''votes''''': A percentage value with the amount of ''votes'' currently cast on other decisions or delegated to other members of the community is shown. The user can tap or click at any time on that value to view a complete list of the issues where he or she is currently having a ''vote'' and decide whether to keep them there or make a strategic change.

* '''Slide to ''vote''''': The user can use his thumb (or mouse click) to slide the ''liquid bar'' handle and upon the release of it he or she will be prompted a confirmation request whether to ''vote'' or not.

* '''Tap to ''vote''''': If the user does not want to allocate more than 1 vote, he or she can simply tap on the ''liquid bar'' handle once and will be prompted to confirm a single ''vote'' transaction.

* '''Remove ''votes''''': At any time, as long as the poll is still open, the user may remove his or her ''votes'' from a decision by simply sliding the ''liquid bar'' handle back to the initial position.

We see this interaction as a step forward from the ''like'' pattern found in social media. ''Likes'' limits voting to mindless clicks and can be inflated at will. Since ''votes'' operate as a scarce resource in the system, they cannot be generated at will and always require a minimum of tactical thinking regarding how a user's interaction will influence a specific decision. ''votes'' have real implications to the user as a stakeholder of a decentralized organization while ''Likes'' only serve their controlling corporations.

====2.3.2 Delegations.====

A ''liquid bar'' also displays the ''vote'' delegation relation a user has with any other member of an organization. Delegations go both ways:

* '''Sent''': A user must be able to delegate any of his available ''votes'' while checking the current delegated amount (if any).

* '''Received''': A user must be able to understand how many ''votes'' were received from someone else.

Every time a member profile is displayed on Sovereign, the current delegation status between the user and the member is shown.

[[File:/images/delegation-relation-votes.png|View of vote delegation relation with another member.]]

====2.3.3 Agora.====

Sovereign also has a debating component codenamed ''Agora''. Debating is likely as important as voting in any democracy. Agoras display ''threaded conversations'', a successful design pioneered by [http://reddit.com Reddit] and [http://news.ycombinator.com Hacker News]. We consider this UX pattern as the best way to engage in thoughtful conversations online as they have the most valued comments bubble up, helping sort the information for a debate using the collective intelligence of the community.

But unlike web based applications, Sovereign does not allow testimonial interactions: instead of permitting infinite ''upvotes'' or ''downvotes'', if the user agrees with a comment from someone else in the platform, it will trigger an instantaneous delegation of a single ''vote''. Hence Agoras permit:

* '''Upvote''': Send a single ''vote'' delegation from the user to the commenter.

* '''Downvote''': If a user disagrees with someone's comment, a ''downvote'' can either retrieve a ''vote'' from the commenter back to the user if there was a previous delegation. Or if no delegation relation exists among them, then a ''downvote'' will act as a penalty sending a ''vote'' from the commenter back to the funds of the organization implementing the Sovereign instance. The criteria for this kind of penalty can be set in the ''constitutional smart contract'' of the implementing organization.

This will make delegations more frequent across the platform. Debates constantly exposed to the risk of ''vote'' transactions means that they are subject to real political impact. This mechanism can help reward good arguments and punish the influence of trolling without requiring the need to develop moderating authorities in the system.

=== 2.4 Pilot ===

<blockquote>
  Blockchain could disrupt voting, just as it has currency, and could apply to any democratic government.
</blockquote>
[https://www.oecd.org/gov/innovative-government/embracing-innovation-in-government-colombia.pdf '''The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development'''], Embracing innovation in government: global trends (2016).

In October 2016, following a shocking, almost universally unexpected No to peace in the Colombian referendum that put at risk years of negotiation between the government & the marxist narco-guerrillas, Democracy Earth piloted the Sovereign liquid democracy platform in a [http://plebiscitodigital.co/ digital plebiscite] enacting a symbolic vote among the diaspora of ~6 million expatriate citizens. Instead of giving a voter the binary option, the pilot enabled people to vote separately on seven individual sub-themes of the proposed treaty, as well as to delegate their votes to more knowledgeable voters, with results revealing important nuances in voter preferences not captured in the referendum, including the [https://words.democracy.earth/a-digital-referendum-for-colombias-diaspora-aeef071ec014 deal breaker that emerged]: an overwhelming “No” among pilot participants to one particular statement of the treaty regarding political participation of the FARC.

[[File:/images/colombia-use-case.png|Colombia use case data..]]

The pilot study had the [https://www.oecd.org/gov/innovative-government/embracing-innovation-in-government-colombia.pdf additional impact] of increasing the media and political profile of blockchain-enabled, decentralized liquid democracy in Colombia; a blockchain-savvy political party has sprung up, the Partido de la Red Colombia party (“The Net Party”), while the Colombian government’s Centre for Digital Public Innovation (CDPI) is investigating the technology as well.

===2.5 Smart Contracts.===

When Claude Shannon wrote his [http://math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf foundational 1948 paper on Information Theory], he was able to demonstrate how circuits can perform logic functions by expressing a binary state of 1 or 0 (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code> states). Since then, digital technology shaped the dynamics of all kinds of information systems. With this in mind we focused on building an efficient design for a governance machine able to operate with blockchains that keeps its human operators as sovereign rulers by means of the vote. In the same way bits move in computers signalling a <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> state, ''votes'' signal a boolean value for institutional decisions to be recorded under smart contracts.

''vote'' tokens operate within the institutional boundaries created by this set of contracts: <code>Organizations</code>, <code>Members</code>, <code>Issues</code>, <code>Ballots</code> and <code>Budgets</code>. These are the building blocks that help create a governance circuit that can scale to operate liquid democracies within communities of any size.

[[File:/images/vote-liquid-democracy-smart-contracts.png|VOTE Liquid Democracy smart contracts..]]

====2.5.1 <code>Organizations</code>====

The entity or institution implementing a Sovereign instance is referred as an <code>Organization</code>. This entity acts as a governing authority definining who are the <code>Members</code> allowed to participate in its decisions and granting them ''vote'' tokens. Since <code>Organizations</code> can live in a decentralized network, the requirements to make an entity able to operate with ''votes'' are similar to those found while setting up a website:

* <code>Domain</code>: Every organization must have its own domain name (e.g. ''democracy.earth'' on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP). Some may even have a namespace running as a Top Level Domain or TLD (e.g. ''.earth''). This reference code for an <code>Organization</code> within an open network, whether its the legacy web as in HTTP or new emergent networks for decentralized domains such as [https://blockstack.org Blockstack], is crucial to help build a semantic layer that effectively describes <code>Issues</code> without the risk of having voters manipulating tags in a closed system (referred on Section 2.5.4 as ''squatting''). Domain names help describe an <code>Issue</code> as well as restricting the scope of a delegation contract.

* <code>Constitution</code>: Every organization has a ''Constitution'' that defines its foundational rules in the form of a smart contract. The ''constitutional smart contract'' describes how <code>Members</code>, <code>Issues</code> and ''votes'' connect within the system.

=====2.5.1.1 <code>Constitution</code>=====

The ''constitutional smart contract'' determines how ''votes'' will be allocated to members among other governance decisions. Allocation conditions are a prerogative of the organization depending on its goals: in some cases it can be aligned with financial rights (e.g. the shareholders of a corporation getting one ''vote'' per share); in other cases it can be assigned based on an egalitarian distribution to all members (e.g. taxpayers within a jurisdiction each getting a same amount of ''votes'').

The basic settings to be found on a constitution are:

* '''Decentralized ID''' (or URL): An identifier that helps refer to the <code>Organization</code> anywhere on the network and that it is connected to its <code>Domain</code>.

* '''Bio''': A basic description of the organization including its name, website, address, jurisdiction (if applicable).

* '''Funding''': The amount of ''vote'' tokens this organization will manage and how these will be allocated to every member and grant access to <code>Budgets</code>.

* '''Membership''': Requirements to become a valid member within the organization. This criteria defines the voter registry that guarantees a fair electoral process of a democracy and can be scrutinized by its members.

** '''Open''': Anyone can freely join an organization.
** '''Voted''': Existing members must vote on applicant members. A percentage criteria must be set for approval.
** '''Fee''': The organization requires a payment for membership approval.

* '''Content''': Defines who is allowed to post <code>Issues</code> on the organization.

** '''Open''': Anyone (whether a member or not) can post. Only members get the right to vote.
** '''Members''': Only approved members have the right to post.
** '''Special Members''': Members that meet certain criteria (e.g. a minimum of delegated ''votes'' or ''votes'' received under a specific tag) have the right to post.
** '''Anonymous''': Defines whether anonymous content is allowed to be posted.

* '''Moderation''': Describes the rules that help define a code of conduct among members of an organization.

** '''Ban''': An amount of ''downvotes'' required to ban a member from participating in the organization and the penalty attached to it (e.g. a period of time)
** '''Expulsion''': If an organization is based on ''Voted Membership Approval'', a member can receive negative votes from other members signalling that such identity has been corrupted or is no longer part of the organization. This criteria can be established as a minimum percentage required.

* '''Voting''': The allowed <code>Ballots</code> to be used for the decisions to be made by the organization and specific settings such as ''quadratic voting''.

* '''Reform''': The requirements to change any of the rules set on a ''Constitution'' (e.g. a special majority).

Templates defining common practices for specific kinds of organizations are encouraged to simplify organizational setup. This will be aided and abetted through work with the Democracy Earth Foundation partnership with [https://aragon.one/ Aragon], who is working on a digital jurisdiction that will make decentralized organizations efficient. Sovereign will include templates for corporations, political parties, trade unions, clubs and cooperative businesses among others; whatever form the organization takes, Aragon's decentralized network ensures that a company will always work, even in the face of malicious tampering by hostile third parties or abusive governments.

====2.5.2 <code>Members</code>====

Every Organization has members that get the right to vote on the decisions of the organization. Membership criteria is defined in the ''constitutional smart contract'' and is key for the trust in any democratic environment. Among the most common ways to subvert an election is through voter registry manipulation. Securing this aspect with cryptographic means as well as an approval protocol is critical. Once a member is approved within an organization, he or she gets a specific amount of ''votes'' to be used for its governance.

All <code>Organizations</code> who take the responsibility to approve or disapprove <code>Members</code>, contribute with this task to the ''Proof of Identity'' process described on Section 3.3.

Compatibility with decentralized identity protocols is encouraged for the purpose of guaranteeing decentralized governance. The [https://opencreds.github.io/did-spec/ specification of DIDs (decentralized identifiers analogous to the web's URIs)], proposed by the [https://www.w3.org/ W3C] enabling self-sovereign verifiable digital identity is recommended.

====2.5.3 <code>Issues</code>====

An organization consists of a collection of ''issues'' each describing a decision to be made by the members. Membership properties described in the ''constitutional smart contract'' define member's voting and posting rights. An issue in its most basic form has these properties:

* <code>Description</code>: Text of the decision to be made.
* <code>Tags</code>: Categories that describe the decision within the organization. This helps members navigate across issues, define areas or teams within an organization and limit the scope of a delegation of ''votes''. If the implementation is done with blockchain environments that are used to manage a fixed taxonomy (like [http://blockstack.org Blockstack]), a common distributed language for tags based on decentralized domains helps making the democratic environment more fair as it avoids members trying to control naming conventions for their own benefit. For this reason, within an open network <code>Tags</code> that describe <code>Issues</code> or are used to constrain delegations, are pointers to other <code>Organizations</code>. This is detailed in the ''Proof of Identity'' process.
* <code>Signatures</code>: Members that are authoring the proposal. It can remain anonymous if an organization's governance rules allows it.
* <code>Ballot</code>: The presented options for voters to participate on this decision.
* <code>Budget</code>: An optional element that may include locked funds in a cryptocurrency address that can trigger an action if a decision is voted in support.
* <code>Timespan</code>: For the final tally, an open poll must also set its scope in time and define the kind of decision being made. There are two types of decisions:
** <code>Tactical</code> (limited in time): These are contracts that receive ''votes'' until a closing date is met, where a given block height within the blockchain implementing the ''vote'' smart contracts can be set as the end line for the electoral process. Once all transactions have been tallied and a final result is recorded, all tokens get returned to the corresponding voters and can be used again on future decisions.
** <code>Strategical</code> (unlimited in time): Never-ending open polls that are perpetually registering the consensus of a decision state. ''votes'' can be retrieved by voters at any given time if they feel the need to discontinue their voice in support or rejection of a decision. But as long as the token is assigned to signal a preference on a contract ballot without closing date, it is part of the strategical decision. A common use for strategical decisions can be the members voting for approval of other members within the community of an organization.

====2.5.4 <code>Ballot</code>====

An issue can be implemented with any possible ballot design according to the specifications defined in the ''constitutional smart contract'' of the organization. The building blocks for a ballot are its <code>Interface</code>, <code>Options</code> and <code>Criteria</code>.

=====2.5.4.1 <code>Interface</code>=====

By default Sovereign provides the most commonly used choice mechanisms for ballot interaction. Further innovation on ballot interfaces is encouraged.

* <code>SingleChoice</code>: One selectable option.
* <code>MultipleChoice</code>: One or more selectable options.
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_voting <code>Cardinal</code>]: A given score per option with a pre-defined range of value.
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting <code>Ranked</code>]: Sortable options as ranked preferences. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem Arrow's impossibility theorem] must be taken into consideration for any innovation regarding ranked ballots. This theorem states that rank-based electoral systems are not able to satisfy fairness on three key aspects at the same time:
** '''Unrestricted domain''': all preferences of all voters are allowed.
** '''Non-dictatorship''': no single voter possesses the power to always determine social preference.
** '''Pareto Efficiency''': if every voter prefers an option to another, then so must the resulting societal preference order.

=====2.5.4.2 <code>Options</code>=====

In order to enable the information processing of ''votes'', ballots carry boolean values expressed in their options. This lets ''vote'' transactions signal a ''decision state'' that will act as a force modeling the institutional choices for the implementing organization. This makes all decentralized organizations also into programmable institutions. Options can then be:

* <code>True</code>: It will signal a <code>true</code> boolean value if selected (often described with 'Yes' or 'Positive' label strings).
* <code>False</code>: Signals a <code>false</code> state (e.g. can display 'No' or 'Negative' labels).
* <code>Linked</code>: The option is connected to another decision within the organization.
* <code>Candidate</code>: A member or list of <code>Members</code> from the organization. This helps elect authorities within the organization or it can be used for membership approvals.

=====2.5.4.3 <code>Criteria</code>=====

Finally, counting methods for the final or ongoing result of a decision within an organization.

* <code>Plurality</code>: Simple majority wins decision.
* <code>Majority</code> A minimum percentage is required for winning decision.
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Hondt_method <code>DHont</code>]: Widely used by Nation-State elections based on member lists.
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method <code>Schulze</code>]: Commonly used by open source communities and Pirate Parties using ranked choice ballots.
* [http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/422/1/1999-66.pdf <code>PageRank</code>]: Counts votes weighting voter reputation in a graph.

====2.5.5 <code>Budget</code>====

Every <code>Organization</code> can have 1 or more cryptocurrency addresses to fund its efforts. Sovereign permits to fund an <code>Organization</code> with Bitcoin and in its <code>Constitution</code> define a criteria on how these assets get distributed among <code>Members</code>:

* '''Percentage for ''Proof of Identity''''': Applicant <code>Members</code> can submit their ''Proof of Identity'' evidence to get membership approval to an <code>Organization</code>. If ''votes'' approve the new member, it strengthens the reputation of a self-sovereign identity in the open network by rewarding him or her a fixed amount of Bitcoin to permit hashing the ''Proof of Identity'' on a blockchain. Some <code>Organizations</code> may allow a bigger reward than others, effectively creating a Reputation score that can protect the network against ''Sybils'' or false identities. This process is detailed on [[#Executive|Section 3]].

* '''Percentage for <code>Issues</code>''': <code>Members</code> seeking to use resources from the <code>Organization</code> can request them by attaching a <code>Budget</code> to an <code>Issue</code>. A <code>Member</code> can request to use funds from a pool specifically reserved for this. If the final tally of a decision reaches a certain value (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>), it can then enforce the final decision by unlocking coins or triggering a transaction sending the requested assets to a specific address.

===2.6 Security.===

With Sovereign we are aiming to provide a lightweight governance framework that permits all stakeholders of an organization to participate and enforce decisions through the use of cryptography. But it is important to state that we are not aiming for a democratic system based on mob-rule or [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majoritarianism ''majoritarism'']. History offers sufficient examples on how a blind majority can end up failing the aspirations of a republic often putting demagogues in power.

[[File:/images/ideal-democracy.png|Ideal democracy.]]

Our main goal is to deliver a system able to guarantee the greatest amount of legitimacy while empowering the most knowledgeable voices in any community. The difference between fact and promise is simple: while the art of politics consists in sustaining the fiction that breeds trust in established institutions (e.g. politicians during campaigns), cryptographic proof of events delivers a more reliable method for trusted governance. The incorruptible nature of blockchain transactions provides an incentive for people not to lie, hence organizations storing votes and decisions in them get driven by facts rather than promises. Corruption can be fought at its root as we develop a new sense of citizenship based on digital networks.

Still, liquid democracies can be gamed in different ways with outcomes dominated by the unintended consequences of two dynamics representing extreme ends of the participation spectrum:

* '''Lack of delegation''' leading to a ''polyopoly'': extreme fragmentation of voting power.
* '''Abundance of delegations''' leading to a ''monopoly'': extreme concentration of voting power.

Each outcome impacts one of the two axes measuring the quality of democratic governance. The incentives on the ''vote'' political economy are designed to keep a stable equilibrium aiming to guarantee the highest level of legitimacy and fact-based decision making.

To become a trusted environment for decentralized governance under large communities (cities, nations or global scale), Sovereign must be protected against different kinds of attackers: ''Mobs'', ''Corporations'', ''Sybils'', ''Fakes'' and ''Big Brother''.

====2.6.1 Polyopoly.====
<blockquote>
  a.k.a. ''Mobs''
</blockquote>

Among the most notable research projects on the field is [http://www.tdcommons.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1092&context=dpubs_series Google Votes]. This was an internal implementation made for Google employees led by engineer Steve Hardt where he created a liquid democracy plug-in to be used on the internal version of Google+. The project had the following numbers in terms of impact:

* 15,000 participants.

* 371 decisions.

* '''3.6% of delegated votes''' in total.

The small percentage in delegations means that Google Votes operated more as a direct democracy than a liquid democracy. Delegations occured mostly among those users who actively campaigned to attract them (e.g. vegans in a team hoping to gather power to choose office snacks). The risk of few delegations is that it opens the democracy to the known risks of mob rule. Although this might keep legitimacy high, the quality of the decisions being made by an organization becomes more political than factual. Knowledgeable voices able to address specific problems within a community become disempowered.

To increase delegation frequency, these happen every time self-sovereigns get validated. On the ''Proof of Identity'' process (see Section 3), users are able to natively generate their own ''votes'' as long as their individuality gets endorsed by other identities. Also since the ''vote'' token operates in a blockchain, delegations don't need to necessarily happen within the Sovereign application: messaging applications, tweets and e-mails can be sent with vote addresses or QR codes attached to them making the vote token able to be broadcasted across multiple networks.

====2.6.2 Monopoly.====
<blockquote>
  a.k.a. ''Corporations''
</blockquote>

When the German Pirate Party implemented [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiquidFeedback Liquid Feedback], a pioneering liquid democracy software developed in 2009, it reached a participation level of ~550 affiliates that led to [http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/liquid-democracy-web-platform-makes-professor-most-powerful-pirate-a-818683.html a linguist professor becoming the most influential member of the party]. Martin Haase was in charge of translating all uploaded propositions in the system to a neutral language in order to avoid any ideological bias, making him grasp 167 delegations from other members.

The consequences of having a monopolizing leader in a liquid democracy environment goes against the spirit of an ecosystem that aims to incentivize more participation. In liquid democracies ''celebrities'' can become extremely influential being able to attract most of the delegated votes. An attacker willing to subvert an election can promote a TV star wearing a QR code to get a sudden influx of delegations from fans and viewers, instantly becoming a monopolizing force. Monopolies are a threat to liquid democracies since they can disincentivize less fortunate voters to participate, hijacking the legitimacy of the decisions being made.

=====2.6.2.1. Quadratic Voting.=====

A key setting of a liquid democracy system is to permit [http://ericposner.com/quadratic-voting/ quadratic voting] for delegations. The cost for Alice to delegate votes to Bob increases exponentially the more votes get delegated. With quadratic delegations Alice can only delegate Bob 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 or even 128 or 512 ''votes'' but no value in between. This makes any delegation tax the delegator by reducing the opportunity cost of delegating to another member. This method prevents the rise of monopolies within the market dynamics of liquid democracies, always making the participation of all members relevant. If some organizations desire a more vertical chain of command (e.g. corporations), quadratic voting can still be disabled in the ''constitutional smart contract'' of a Sovereign implementation.

====2.6.3 Sybil Attack.====
<blockquote>
  a.k.a. ''Identity Theft''
</blockquote>

Whoever has the ability to control the registry of voters of any given election can directly influence the end result. A classical example is registering defunct members of society to vote in an election. On decentralized networks this is commonly referred as a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack sybil attack] (a name taken from an [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kPIDt3yu1M homonymous 1976 film] based on a character that suffers a multiple personality syndrome). Sybil nodes are those that identify themselves as independent actors in the network while they all are under the control of a single operator. In decentralized environments sybil attacks are the most common threat and for this reason we consider it indispensable that for ''votes'' to be granted they must get validated through a protocol (social and algorithmic) that works as ''Proof of Identity''.

====2.6.4 Fake news.====
<blockquote>
  a.k.a. ''Gossip''
</blockquote>

It is no coincidence that the battlefield of modern democracies is disputed in the media. News organizations have unprecedented capacity to shape voter perception. Across different jurisdictions worldwide, governments wage an internal war between the State and the largest local media conglomerate. This is the playbook behind Donald Trump and his fight against the CNN & New York Times tandem; or the reason Vladimir Putin invested significant resources to create Russia Today in order to have a way of presenting alternative facts. Controlling the message tends to matter more than truth itself. Free media and independent journalism are a fundamental requirement for stable democracies. But if evidence of institutional facts are hard to prove, the room for manipulation is greater than the room for truth to prevail. Traditional institutions are secretive and lack transparency even if they are public offices. Blockchains enable a way of storing institutional facts that guarantees transparency in organizations. In this sense, ''fake news'' can be fought with a new institutional model able to store ''Hard Promises''.

=====2.6.4.1 Hard Promises=====

Corporations and public institutions are prone to corruption because decisions often happen in secrecy behind closed doors while accounting happens over time. Effectively, organizations are ''decision laundering'' by disconnecting accountability from the decisions. The lack of an incorruptible timeline storing financial and political decisions enables such inaccountability. The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan_(book) ''Leviathan'' State] is an inefficient machine: although it proclaims itself as the sovereign ruler for any given population by means of force, whoever is in charge of running its bureaucracy can still be corrupted making the whole house of cards fall apart. This distance between fact and accounting is the source of gossip.

The building blocks of institutions consist of facts that define agreements. But the kind of facts agreements contain are of a very specific type: Institutions are not built with objective facts that are scientific, measurable and independent from human judgment; but rather inter-subjective facts that build the social world within a community setting the relations of property and rights. For example, the notion that every red can of soda belongs to the Coca Cola Corporation is not objective but an inter-subjective fact agreed upon by all members of society acknowledging the intellectual property rights that a company has over its product. In this way, institutional reality helps scale economic relations and reduces the information required for organizations to transact.

The bureaucracies that protect these agreements depend on promises, i.e. “all money kept in banks will be there tomorrow”. But as [https://twitter.com/aantonop/ Andreas Antonopoulos] states: “We’re used to systems of soft promises and reversible transactions.” If the government (or any other kind of central authority) wanted to confiscate private funds stored in a bank, nobody can stop them from breaking that promise. This has been the experience of Greek, Argentine, Venezuelan or Puerto Rican citizens with their own defaulting governments in the past decade. Blockchain based organizations on the other hand offer an alternative of ''hard promises'': agreements stored in smart contracts strictly protected by cryptography that no single third party can corrupt. Rather than regulating human behaviour post-facto as government law does, blockchains guarantee transparency by default incentivizing honest behaviour since every participant is aware that institutional events will be available for open scrutiny.

====2.6.5 Squatting.====
<blockquote>
  a.k.a. ''Big brother''
</blockquote>

A liquid democracy operates across domains. Setting up an <code>Organization</code> within a network of delegatable ''votes'' is analogous to spinning up a server on the web. Domain squatting is the practice of occupying abandoned or unused web addresses in expectation of a profit. This has led to a billion dollar market having the most commonly used words (identifiers) as the best kind of digital real estate, e.g. [http://sex.com Sex.com] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex.com#Highest_price_paid_for_domain being the highest price paid domain].

On a large scale, liquid democracy's game eventually grows around the <code>Tags</code> being used to describe delegations and issues. In a closed system, the most used <code>Tags</code> point to a reduced universe of relevant voters leading the delegations related to them. Reduced voter participation increases the prediction ability of a democracy, reducing the moments open up for collective decision-making. Democracy thrives as long as participation is incentivized. To prevent this exploit, financial and political interests must be aligned. ''Tag squatting'' can be prevented if the taxonomy used to make liquid delegations and issue descriptions operates in an open network: <code>Tags</code> refer to <code>Organizations</code> that are registered under a decentralized domain name system, considering that every <code>Organization</code> needs a domain name. [Blockstack.org Blockstack's blockchain] specializes on decentralized domain names currently managing over 70,000 Dentralized IDs (DIDs). These are obtained via a ''Proof of Burn'' process where users burn Bitcoin in exchange for Blockstack tokens that permit registering a new namespace.

Words define political ideas. The social narrative built by the art of politics consists of deciding semantic intention. Power defines the theatrical impressions that imprint our memories each time we say ''left'', ''right'', ''free'' or ''equal''. Language is a legacy code that enables large scale human collaboration and its virtues cannot be dennied.

----

All of these strategies attack the core of how a decentralized organization institutionalizes itself. In other words: define the risks on how Democracy Earth allocates ''votes'' to its members on the blockchain as a decentralized entity. For this reason, we detail on [[#Execution|Section 3]] a rollout plan for ''votes'' that raises strong defenses against these kind of attacks and paves the way for a global democracy.

<div id="Execution"></div>

==3. Execution.==

[[File:/images/humans.png|Humans on Earth.]]

A pressing fact that goes to the core of what is behind the political and economical challenges of the 21st century is the rise in population growth: [https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/ United Nations estimates that by the year 2100 the world will surpass 10,000,000,000 sapiens]. In other words: the planet’s [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrying_capacity carrying capacity] will be reached by the end of this century.

Clues on the risks of running out of resources can be found in the cultural legacy of islands. A far away land such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Easter_Island Easter Island] was during most of its history a closed system lacking any contact with the rest of the world. Its population had no means for survival other than its own resources, constantly facing the dangers of famine, epidemics and civil war. Even though these menaces seem far off under a globalized economy, the sudden rise in human population during the past century is the driving force behind increasing CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the atmosphere and the collapse of public infrastructure unable to deal with massive migrations. Refugees are escaping wars that seek to secure energy resources for a future that is coming at us fast as the pace of technological innovation accelerates. Though some have already put escape plans into place, including private efforts to reach Mars in the upcoming decades (resembling the biblical story of Noah's Ark), the urgent call to safeguard humanity as a whole must be both amplified and answered.

Distribution of opportunity and intelligent collaboration accross the globe cannot be achieved peacefully unless every voice gets heard, without exceptions. Global governance is the next logical step in a world already connected over the Internet. Blockchains lead towards the possibility of liquid governance laying out the foundations for a democracy of peers. Permission from established Nation-States is not required: citizens anywhere in the world can embrace this change using sovereign networks.

===3.1 Rights vs. Debt.===
<blockquote>
   “What is justice?” the philosopher asked.
   “Pay your debts and don’t lie” Kefalos (capital), a wealthy arms manufacturer, replied.
</blockquote>
'''Plato''', ''Republic''. Philosopher (428-348 BC).

Although politics and economics are often perceived as different realms, history teaches that money means power and power means votes. In order to effectively promote democracy it is essential to address both.

The association of debt, morality and wars remains at the root of the economic mental models of society. Coins were first created by the great empires to finance wars by enabling the purchase of provisions for soldiers in distant regions and rewarding them for victory. Soldiers could loot silver and gold from conquered cities and then exchange it afterwards as the emperors minted coins with the precious metals in order to create markets. Eventually empires would also ask for a share of those coins to be given back as a tax that was directed at the maintenance of the army. The moral narrative was that citizens were ''indebted'' to the emperor for their security, for being alive. Debt evolved to justify any form of coercion sustaining the power hierarchies in countries anywhere. Lack of liquidity is the most tangible and immediate barrier to freedom under which the majority of humanity finds themselves.

The ''vote'' token will be distributed as a '''Right''' opposing the historical association of '''Debt''' and morals, generating a new breeding ground for transactions that are not based on the possibility of coercion. It aims to bring equivalence to transacting entities, restoring balance and fairness as the new moral standard. Democracy Earth's core motivation is enabling freedom and personal sovereignty, a possibility that can only be reached if individuals are able to say 'no' and choose an alternative order uncoerced and free. This cannot be achieved with induced scarcity as it is often found in most crypto assets, but rather through a guaranteed access to ''votes'' to every member of society turning governance rights into a liquid instrument.

For this reason, [http://democracy.earth Democracy Earth Foundation] will generate an ''Initial Rights Offering'' of ''vote'' tokens designed to reach everyone on Earth under a process that will offer two mechanisms: crypto funding for anyone willing to allocate resources that strengthen the development of a global democracy with the ''vote'' token; and a rights mechanism as a native way of getting ''vote'' tokens by anyone able to ''mine'' his or her corresponding share of ''votes'' through a ''Proof of Identity'' process.

====3.1.1 Initial Rights Offering.====

Identity is foundational to personal sovereignty and the kernel of all voting systems. Votes (on any system) are valid if and only if membership is verified within an organization, no democracy can run on corrupted identities. Today’s standard identity systems are based on central authorities forcing users to share private information, risking identity theft if they get hacked. Precedents include [https://gov.uk United Kingdom's Gov.UK] and [https://uidai.gov.in/ India’s Aadhaar], both which have been plagued by reports of improper security practices that included leaks compromising the privacy of millions.

For identities to be self-sovereign, they cannot be owned or controlled by governments, organizations or corporations that ultimately have as a priority the extraction of value from their users. Our approach with [http://sovereign.software Sovereign] is that it is organization-centric as a technology, but an organization can become decentralized if its identity verification process lacks the need for an authority. Ultimately, any process dependent on decentralized identity is part of a global commons since the principle of a self-sovereign identitiy renders any ''Big Brother'' irrelevant. Therefore, the key to sustain the value of the ''vote'' token as a means for a borderless democracy is to effectively validate all participating identities through a decentralized process that can create, update or revoke keys. This is how Democracy Earth Foundation will grant access to ''votes'' as a human right.

[[File:/images/identity-blockchain.png|Self-sovereign Identity.]]

Anyone able to demonstrate his or her own identity under a decentralized protocol referred to as ''Proof of Identity'' (POI) can operate with a corresponding share of ''votes''. This mechanism will trigger an allocation throughout time in the claimed public address of the identity which is accessible through a self-hosted wallet connected to the content and data used for the POI. If sufficient ''votes'' validate the evidence used for the ''Proof of Identity'', the wallet will unfreeze a corresponding amount of ''votes'' following the rules of a ''Universal Basic Income'' dynamic that allocates tokens throughout time using the Bitcoin blockchain as a universal clock.

===3.2 Proof of Identity.===

A self-sovereign identity must be voluntarily generated by a user claiming it. For this purpose the user must broadcast a proof of his or her identity that strictly satisfies a criteria that can be met by human judgment and able to avoid an artificial intelligence from interfering with the process. Hence, the proof shall be in a format that requires a large amount of cerebral bandwidth: video. A satisfactory proof shall meet all of these properties:

* '''Incorruptible''': The video file must be protected against any modifications once it has been used as a source for proof.
* '''Singular''': The proof shall validate a single identity without allowing duplicated participants in the network (''replicants'').
* '''Reputable''': Any <code>Organization</code> validating a POI attaches its reputation to the proven identity with its signature.

Even though any digital governance system can benefit from the trust already present in existing networks that validate identities (i.e. Nation-States), a decentralized protocol for validating identities serves the political purpose of personal sovereignty. The benefits of this public record in a networked commons can eventually be used by governments or private organizations in different ways (e.g. verifying age or nationality). Here we propose a new method for validating identities without the need of a single ''Big Brother''.

A ''Proof of Identity'' expires after a given period of time in order to prevent Sybil attacks and ensure that only living users are participating in the network. To maintain the validity of the public-private key pair we suggest a period of 1 year is sufficient to generate a new proof updating the previous one. In the same way that physical identities are checked by comparing picture to person, users will need to re-create their ''Proof of Identity'' and broadcast it for verification in order to authenticate their legitimacy. This year period can be referred colloquially as the ''blockbirth'' of an individual and, if desired, celebrated on a yearly basis in the same way nations celebrate their independence day. As newborn babies are registered under this global jurisdiction, ''blockbirths'' get synced with birth dates and will be able to incorruptibly attest for age as well gradually reducing the work of authenticators over time.

====3.2.1 Demo.====

[[File:/images/roma-siri-blockchain-baby.png|Roma Siri's blockchain birth certificate.]]

There is a precedent that helps to illustrate how a ''Proof of Identity'' works. [https://youtu.be/Irc-VMuUs3c?t=55m20s According to NYU professor David Yermack], newborn Roma Siri became the first baby to have a blockchain valid birth certificate on November 7, 2015. The process, even though symbolic at the time, consisted of [https://www.dropbox.com/s/tsi4xo4k6j1jsa6/Blockchain%20Birth%20Certificate%20of%20Roma%20Siri%20-%20Daughter%20of%20Santiago%20Siri%20%28father%29%20and%20Pia%20Mancini%20%28mother%29.MOV?dl=0 a video showing baby Roma that described her vital signs and included witnesses of her birth]. Once the video was filmed, a cryptographic hash of the digital file was generated and encoded into a Bitcoin transaction. This means that regardless where the video is stored, the permanent record of its hash on the Bitcoin blockchain can verify that the file's data was not corrupted and that it existed at the time the proof was generated. With this incorruptible evidence, Roma became a blockchain-certified global citizen.

This demo serves as an example for the steps that need to be followed for a decentralized ''Proof of Identity'':

# '''Film proof''' using any available smartphone or camera.
# '''Hash proof''' on a blockchain to guarantee incorruptibility of evidence.
# '''Validate proof''' through a voting process among peers (''Attention Mining'').

====3.2.2 Video Proof.====

A proof can be done with any recording application as long as it satisfies the requirements of the protocol. An extension no longer than 3 minutes is recommended for the video. In it the user must follow a series of scripted steps in order to help validators judge with their attention:

# '''Face''': Under frontal light, film frontal expression (as when taking a ''selfie'') and each side of the head without wearing eyeglasses, hats, makeup or masks of any kind.

# '''Names''': Say out loud the following indicators:
## Full given name (language-based identity).
## Full surname (blood-based identity, additionally it can state information regarding mother and father).
## Nationality (territorial-based identity, it can include place of residence or tax paying jurisdiction).
## Alternatively the user can use a nickname if it is a more common pointer to his self.

# '''Biometrics''' (Optional): Say out loud or demonstrate in a reliable way any of these indicators. This can be useful for specific use cases such as birth certificates.
## Birthday (day, month and year).
## Height (inches or centimeters).
## Weight (pounds or kilograms).
## Gender (male, female, etc).

# '''Witnesses''' (Optional): Previously validated identities can act as witnesses for this identity. They can be physically on location and appear in the video stating their full names and public keys to endorse a new identity.
## The witnesses can get granted the rights to revoke, update or cancel this proof (e.g. in case of loss of private keys or biological death).
## Twins. Those who have a twin brother or sister must specify this to prevent being flagged as a ''replicant'' during the verification process.
## Certifications. Even though this would be falling back to central authority, legacy reputation from state-issued documents can help make a video proof easier to trust. This might include a birth certificate, driver's license or a national ID as long as it doesn't hold any sensitive information (e.g. using a Social Security Number in the US).

# '''Declaration''': To guarantee that the person generating his or her identity proof is aware of the rights he will receive upon having his membership approved on the network and is not being coerced by an unseen attacker, it is mandatory to make a declaration of self-sovereignty that also includes an oath regarding the stated facts: <blockquote>I, (Personal Name), declare that I'm making this video in accordance to my personal sovereignty as a citizen of Earth and all the statements made are true. I will be the sole user of all the ''votes'' allocated on behalf of this proof and I'm acting without any threat or coercion against my free will.</blockquote>

# '''Public Key''': An address where ''votes'' will be allocated if identity is validated. This will be the [https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/ID2020DesignWorkshop/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/DID-Whitepaper.md Decentralized Identifier (DID)] pointing to this user. If this identity eventually is voted as corrupted or the user (or any listed witness) revoke it, then the allocated ''votes'' will get invalidated for future use.

# '''Timestamp''': Current block height of the blockchain used for hashing this video to prevent any videos unrelated to the moment in time the POI is being generated to be used as proof. A manual timestamp can simply film the screen of a blockchain explorer application displaying the last block number and the hash corresponding to it. Since this might be complex for most users, apps designed to generate this proof can automatically add this content to the video. This information once the proof is hashed with a blockchain transaction will certify the video was not modified in any possible way by a third party after it was broadcasted to the network.

Even though this process can be more complex than the average sign-up form found on most applications, it is important to state that it is also a political act declaring independence from authorities of any kind. This video is the personal manifesto anyone can make to break free from coercion and a step taken towards a borderless democracy.

====3.2.3 Hashing.====

Once the digital file with the self-sovereign proof has been generated, a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function cryptographic hash function] applied to it is calculated. Following the steps of the implementation made by Manuel Araoz and Esteban Ordano with [https://proofofexistence.com ProofofExistence.com], a standard [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2 SHA-256] digest is recommended. Once the hash has been generated, it can be encoded in a Bitcoin transaction using an [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/OP_RETURN OP_RETURN] script that also includes a marker that helps track identity-related proofs. We suggest using 'IDPROOF' (0x494450524f4f46) for this particular use case.

Considering that an average bitcoin transaction consists of 226 bytes with a mining fee as of August 2017 at 27,120 satoshis, the cost for hashing a proof directly on the blockchain is at ~$1 per proof. This can be relatively expensive for a majority of people, hence we recommend scaling this process by enabling a [https://github.com/aantonop/chainpoint Chainpoint] implementation able to store up to 10,000 proofs per transaction by putting the hashed data on a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree Merkle Tree] and encoding the Merkle root in the OP_RETURN script instead. This will also significantly reduce the memory requirements of the Bitcoin blockchain, a public resource that must not be abused. Alternatively, virtualchains that run on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that have a focus on identity and namespaces such as [http://blockstack.org Blockstack] can be used to satisfy this use case and the management of the private-public key pair.

Any proof that goes through this process in a digital context is guaranteed to not be corrupted in any way. The digital files being used as proof can be stored anywhere, copied without restrictions or even kept in secret without sharing it with anyone. As long as there is a transaction in the blockchain that can validate the encoded hash with the data of the digital file, then the evidence is valid. The Bitcoin blockchain offers the strongest resistance to corruption since it has the largest amount of hashing power in the world protecting its infrastructure. With this mechanism in place, the Bitcoin blockchain can operate as a decentralized index of self-sovereign identities. Leveraging this capacity will only make the bureaucracy of a borderless democracy stronger than any other government on Earth.

====3.2.4 Attention Mining.====

[[File:/images/proof-of-identity.png|Proof of Identity.]]

In computer-space identities are nothing but pointers: algorithms lack any awareness about the patterns they are trained to recognize. Identities strictly belong to the human realm (i.e. only a person can recognize another person). So rather than harnessing ''distributed computing power'' to verify transactions as it happens with most cryptocurrencies, ''votes'' use ''distributed attention power'' to verify self-generated identity proofs. This attention is brought in by human participants that act as validators.

A well known precedent of attention mining are CAPTCHA tests often found in the login of high-traffic websites. CAPTCHA is an acronym for ''Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart''. These consist of simple vision exercises that can be completed by a human more easily than by a computer. A field [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/reCAPTCHA_Science.pdf pioneered by researcher Louis Von Ahn], he used this technique to help build datasets able to train machine learning algorithms to read words printed on paper. As a Google engineer Von Ahn created a simple test distributed across all login pages that displayed two words obtained from scanned pictures. A user would write both words in a text input field to prove he is human and not a machine. The system already knew the meaning of the first word (hence validating the user is human) but it got trained with the second input as it used this information in the dataset for character recognition algorithms. This simple exercise has been extended to train all kinds of pattern recognition systems and it contributed to the security of websites, preventing bots (and botnets) from intruding.

Attention can also validate human identities in a decentralized network, analogous to [https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf Bitcoin's Proof of Work algorithm (POW)] used by mining nodes to timestamp peer to peer transactions. In Bitcoin, each miner generates its own blockchain-compatible proof hash for a new block of transactions and broadcasts it to the network. If 51% of the nodes in the network accept the verified block, it gets chained to the blockchain and the miner starts working on the next transaction block using the accepted block as the previous hash. This technique permits monetary transactions without central banks. In a democracy without central governments instead of verifying encrypted blocks, human attention serves the purpose of voting on self-generated identities in order to grant them ''votes'' which can eventually be used for new verifications.

Most of the research concerning how to prevent sybil attacks (identity forgery on peer to peer networks) revolves around requiring entities to perform a task that a sybil attacker would not be able to perform. Attention mining requires validators to observe certain aspects of ''Proof of Identity'' videos that only a person can recognize. In order to have a mechanism that prevents bots, the system can generate modified videos to induce attackers to error. These distortions can be created through cropping certain sections out of a video, mixing it with others or distorting voices to work as a video version of a CAPTCHA test aimed to securely distinguish between real human validators and botnets.

====3.2.5 Little Brothers.====
<blockquote>
  Who watches the watchmen?
</blockquote>
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen '''''Watchmen'''''], graphic novel (1987).

Self-sovereign identities can be valued on two key aspects that help define their right to participate in the network:

* '''Reputation''': A social indicator that a given identity is to be trusted.
* '''Singularity''': An individual indicator that certifies an identity is uniquely tied to a single person.

Anyone on the network can participate to verify new self-sovereigns in order to secure a global democracy against the threat of a ''Big Brother''. This task is effectively performed whenever an <code>Organization</code> decides to approve a new <code>Member</code>. By harnessing distributed attention across multiple <code>Organizations</code> instead of an all-observing central power, validators are in effect an army of [http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/crypto/cypherpunks/little-brother.txt little brothers] who can collaboratively score a self-sovereign identity in the network. ''Little brothers'' can outperform centralized identity providers in terms of accuracy as they are constantly incentivized to maintain legitimacy within the network in order to keep ''votes'' as a valuable asset: the success of the network on detecting ''replicants'' (duplicated identities) determines the scarcity of the ''vote'' token. The legitimacy of any democracy is based on the maintenance of a proper voter registry.

=====3.2.5.1 Reputation.=====

The interest on effectively validating a ''Proof of Identity'' is among <code>Organizations</code> that must deal with applicant identities willing to become <code>Members</code> able to use their ''votes'' for the decisions related to the entity. Those who within an <code>Organization</code> have the rights to approve new memberships end up contributing with the reputation an <code>Organization</code> has to the applicant identity if approved.

The allocation of reputation from an <code>Organization</code> to an approved <code>Member</code> that applied with its POI is done by simply signing the approved POI to certify that an identity is a valid <code>Member</code>. The memberships connected to an identity in the network can be interpreted by future validators on other <code>Organizations</code> in any desired way. <code>Organizations</code> in the network can be as small as a family or as large as a multi-national corporation, but ultimately they are <code>domains</code> in a network that can resemble <code>Tags</code> describing the attributes of an identity. Some <code>Organizations</code> may exist for very specific verifications, e.g. an <code>Organization</code> under a ''legal.age'' domain that only verifies if a POI belongs to someone older than 18 years making any approved <code>Member</code> of such entity carry a valid ''legal.age'' signature on its POI.

The reputation of an <code>Organization</code> can be measured on how often they end up allowing [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicant ''replicants''] as <code>Members</code>. In other words: <code>Organizations</code> that fail on the ''Singularity score'' used to value the individuality of participants in the network, end up being less trustworthy than those able to effectively include sovereign individuals.

=====3.2.5.2 Replicants.=====

While governments need to verify the family tree of a potential new citizen and traditional corporations need to rely on [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer ''Know Your Customer''] practices (KYC) to draw a line between their clients and the rest of the world; a global democracy has no such concern for establishing a difference between ''us and them''. The goal of Democracy Earth Foundation is to scale the right to use ''votes'' to every single human: we are all ''us'' (or ''them''). Hence, the overall challenge for a successful decentralized ''Proof of Identity'' dynamic is to simply focus on using the available attention in the network to check for ''replicants'' that are requesting a share of ''votes''.

''Replicants'' are identities that get ''voted'' as duplicates, illegitimately claiming more ''votes'' than they deserve. Fake POIs are likely to happen using modern techniques of 3D rendering aiming to trick the human eye (e.g. beating the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley uncanny valley] of perception), but it is a safe assumption to consider that [http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2014/papers/Taigman_DeepFace_Closing_the_2014_CVPR_paper.pdf humans are able to recognize faces with 98% of accuracy] while [http://www.washington.edu/news/2016/06/23/how-well-do-facial-recognition-algorithms-cope-with-a-million-strangers/ the capacity of algorithmic systems decrease when scaled]. Considering that the frontier being drawn is between humans and artificial intelligences is that we use the term ''replicant'' which was coined for the 1982 film ''Blade Runner'' referring to androids capable of simulating being real people.

=====3.2.5.3 Singularity Score.=====

To certify an identity is valid, verifiers are exposed to two simultaneous POI videos that can be chosen at random from all the indexed and hashed videos found on the blockchain. A face-matching algorithm that seeks similarities among facial expressions can be used to optimize the test. Validators must use ''votes'' to agree whether these POI videos belong to a same person or not, being the ongoing result of this decision a ''Singularity score'' for the identity.

The validation process is the same as in every Sovereign voting dynamic: Validators can approve by casting a ''vote'' that includes a <code>Ballot</code> with a <code>true</code> checked <code>Option</code> on it. Otherwise they must cast a ''vote'' in rejection with a <code>false</code> checked <code>Option</code>. All POI related decisions are <code>Strategical</code>: without a closing date where allocated ''votes'' impact in real time. At any time a validator can override the ''vote'' value if it has found evidence that modifies previous judgment. Also ''votes'' validating a POI can be removed if the identity already has input from sufficient validators which makes allocation of additional ''votes'' redundant. As with any Sovereign decision, the end result of a POI related vote will end up on either a <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> value. Anyone who ends up being voted as a ''replicant'' will see his or her granted ''votes'' useless.

The <code>Criteria</code> used for the ''Singularity score'' is also subject for voting by every validated POI participating in the network. Democracies are always a work in progress, perpetually self-correcting with a feedback loop that defines how the observers get observed. The threshold that establishes the sovereign right to ''vote'' must constantly adapt to the exponential growth of computing capacity that can risk subverting the network. By being backed with a decentralized identity index using an incorruptible blockchain that gets maintained with distributed attention (i.e. an open face book), the ''vote'' token becomes a trusted device for a digital democracy to emerge anywhere. Allocating attention to secure the network not only brings consciousness to a system otherwise blind to artificial Intelligence, but also allows participants to own their identities without being coerced by a centralized power that could monetize from it without consent. Conscious attention must always be put in the service of strengthening a global democracy because it is only in the realm of human consciousness that we can define what it means to be human.

===3.3 Universal Basic Income.===
<blockquote>
  Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy.
</blockquote>
'''Martin Luther King Jr.''', Minister and activist (1929-1968).

The ability to develop a reliable self-sovereign identity validation process not only guarantees the legitimate value for ''votes'' to express social choice but also establishes the bedrock for the infrastructure required to make a ''Universal Basic Income'' (UBI) mechanism that can reach everyone on Earth. The symbiotic relationship of UBI and democracy has been well substantiated. According to research presented at Basic Income Earth Network (Munich September 2012), the implementation of basic income [http://basicincome.org/bien/pdf/munich2012/Choi.pdf can greatly contribute to realizing the principles of democracy as well as the establishment of its substantial foundation]. Therefore in order to consolidate the political and financial logic able to establish a borderless democracy, once a ''Proof of Identity'' is validated by peers the distribution mechanism triggered for ''votes'' will be based on time as a UBI.

Time is a valuable and limited asset, therefore tradable. One cannot buy, rent or hire more time: it has an inelastic supply no matter how high the demand. [https://books.google.com/books?id=sjlVAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA5&lpg=PA5&dq=what+is+money+man%27s+birthright+time&source=bl&ots=uxfZPDT94J&sig=gWf_LpHeEA-g6ukveZ1-mQI3FE4&hl=es&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjgyuHR2ejVAhUK7iYKHUX0AzgQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&q=what%20is%20money%20man's%20birthright%20time&f=false Time is the only standard of value by which to test all the labour, either manual or mental, done by men and women]. And by tokenizing time and using it as the basis for allocating ''votes'', it liquidates a possession that every member of a global democracy possesses on equal terms. Liquidity is a requirement for any democracy that aims to avoid coercion: voices must be able to be heard in order to count and by granting ''votes'' as a UBI we are tapping on delivering a human right that can effectively empower individuals that will have to face the coming challenges of automation. ''Votes'' granted throughout time as a right avoids the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons ''tragedy of the commons''] while it sets the foundations for a governance model that goes beyond debt and Nation-States.

A self-sovereign then, is able to obtain ''votes'' in three different ways:

* '''Delegation''': Any <code>Member</code> within an <code>Organization</code> operating as a liquid democracy can get delegated ''votes''.
* '''Grant''': <code>Organizations</code> may grant ''votes'' to new participants on its own terms. Participants can create or fund <code>Organizations</code> using their own ''votes''.
* '''Drip''': Once a ''Proof of Identity'' becomes valid, ''votes'' begin to drip into the user's wallet over time.

====3.3.1 Dripping.====

The rate at which 1 ''vote'' gets dripped to a verified identity is syncronized with the Bitcoin blockchain. By using Bitcoin's synchronization mechanism as a clock, an incorruptible consensus sets the rhythm for the whole network. Bitcoin chains a new block to the blockchain every 10 minutes, which means,

  1 hour = 6 blocks

Assuming that earnable time across the globe is based on 8 hour work days,

  8 hours per day x 5 days per week x 52 weeks per year = 2,080 hours per year

Or in block time,

  2,080 hours = 12,480 blocks

And considering that established consensus on [https://medium.com/economicsecproj/how-to-reform-welfare-and-taxes-to-provide-every-american-citizen-with-a-basic-income-bc67d3f4c2b8 an ideal basic income rate averages around 10% of an individual's earnings] we can define that,

  10% earnings Annual Basic Income = 208 hours per year = 1,248 blocks

Which means that of the ~52,560 blocks that register a full year of activity on Bitcoin's blockchain, a total of 1,248 blocks should be accounted for rewarding a UBI per year. To sync ''vote'' dripping with Bitcoin as a UBI mechanism based on 10% earnings for every working hour, 1 full unit of a ''vote'' token should then drip every ~42 hours (or ~252 blocks). For the purpose of guaranteeing a feasible divisibility of the ''vote'' token so it can be dripped every few seconds (while it also becomes easier for human and machine interpretation), we set the dripping rate at,

  1 vote = 250 blocks

So every valid POI gets granted a total of:

  210 votes per year

[[File:/images/proof-of-identity-dripping.png|Dripping mechanism for mined votes.]]

Therefore by taking into account the following variables:

* T = Present block height (i.e. current Time).
* r = A constant for ''vote'' allocation rate, set at 1 vote every 250 blocks in time.
* Pᵢ = The ''Proof of Identity'' block containing its corresponding hash for a given identity (i).
* Sᵢ = ''Singularity score'' expressed as a <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> state for a given identity (i).
* Vᵢ = Total quantity of ''votes'' for a given identity (i).

Then the ''votes'' a self-sovereign identity is allowed to use in the system can be calculated on any node running a smart contract with the formula:

[[File:/images/ubi-vote-formula.png|Vᵢ = ((T - Pᵢ) / r) * Sᵢ]]

As long as the ''Proof of Identity'' has been validated by the community and a smart contract is synced with an active blockchain node, then the value of Vᵢ will either be a number that defines the total amount of ''votes'' a self-sovereign has as a right to use on a hosted wallet or, if the POI is rejected (i.e. Sᵢ = <code>false</code>), then the participant's available votes becomes zero.

====3.3.2 Equality====

The described dripping dynamic ends up benefitting early-adopters as it is often the case with financial-oriented cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin for instance is often described as ''cryptographically induced scarcity'' as it is an instrument able to measure wealth in terms of economical resources due to the fixed scarcity of its token. But with the ''vote'' token we are building a network of a different nature that aims to be complementary to financial cryptocurrencies by having governance as a goal. By issuing ''votes'' as a right that can be granted to anyone as long as his or her singular identity is proven, the ''vote'' operates as political clout. So in essence, our approach is about ''cryptographically induced equality'': such is the basis for any real democracy. For this reason we introduce another variable to its ''Universal Basic Income'' dynamic,

* E = Amount of ''votes'' allocated to the ''Genesis Identity'' at present block height (T).

We refer to the ''Genesis Identity'' as the very first ''Proof of Identity'' that gets approved by the network. With this information the next validated identity won't begin in disadvantage: it will have a wallet with the same amount of ''votes'' than the first participant in the network currently has. Since this rule applies to every participant it will guarantee ''Equality'' in terms of participation letting everyone have the same amount of Sovereign ''votes'' than everyone else, extending the UBI formula as follows:

[[File:/images/ubi-equality-formula.png|Vᵢ = (E + ((T - Pᵢ) / r)) * Sᵢ]]

With the ''Equality'' variable, if a second participant Bob got validated 1500 blocks after a first one Alice, he won't begin with 0 ''votes'' but rather get an initial amount matching Alice's current balance at that moment (i.e. at a rate of 1 ''vote'' per 250 blocks, it is a total of 6 ''votes''). Bob will continue to get ''votes'' dripped on equal terms with Alice block after block after that. If a third participant Charlie generates a valid ''Proof of Identity'' 1000 blocks later, he will begin with the equivalent amount of ''votes'' that Alice and Bob each currently have by then as well (i.e. a total of 10 ''votes'' each). With this inflation process that rewards every new participant (diluting all pre-existing ones), everyone is guaranteed an ''equal'' share in the overall participating rights of the network. As long as ''replicants'' get successfully banned, the ''vote'' network is a genuinely democratic global commons.

[[File:/images/chart-votes-coins-time.png|Vote emission and inflation rate.]]

Even though the inflation rate might initially seem too aggressive, the total supply of ''votes'' is still fixed to a maximum cap based on the quantity of participants in the network. As more participants engage, the overall inflation will tend to limit 0% since new ''votes'' have a reduced influence in the economy as a whole. When compared to uncapped ''likes'' and ''retweets'' in other social applications, it must be noted that from the subjectivity of each individual the allocation of ''votes'' is still a decision based on a limited resource that implies opportunity costs, forcing a more rational behaviour rather than impulsive liking (i.e. trolling).

====3.3.3 Nakamoto Coefficient====

Significant efforts on quantifying decentralization are being made, including Balaji Srinivasan's work on establishing a [https://news.21.co/quantifying-decentralization-e39db233c28e ''Nakamoto Coefficient''] defined as:

<blockquote>
  The minimum number of entities in a given subsystem required to get to 51% of the total capacity.
</blockquote>

The importance of measuring decentralization relies on finding a metric able to certify the ability of a network to be censorship resistant, this being a fundamental property for self-sovereign currencies such as Bitcoin. But ultimately the question of who is in control of the entities running a networked system must be addressed as well. By establishing a reference network that guarantees an egalitarian distribution of its token based on a ''Proof of Identity'' mechanism designed to prevent ''replicants'', this brings in a new perspective that can help increase the resolution of the Nakamoto Coefficient by means of discernible equal access.

By guaranteeing an equal starting point for every participant regardless of the time they decide to join the network, the ''vote'' network operates as a genuine meritocracy. The proposed ''Equality'' variable is simply a rule for establishing a starting point and by no means a permanent imposition: at any time, any self-sovereign is allowed to either delegate ''votes'' to someone else or use them to start an <code>Organization</code> in the network. In this way, the ''vote'' token can work as a device fit to foster a wave of entrepreneurship even among today's disenfranchised individuals left out by the legacy financial and political systems. But as this happens on the individual level, the overall statistics of the network itself works as a reference framework in which to effectively measure decentralization down to each human across the globe and identify opportunities where its needed as it grows.

The value of the network does not reside on the simulated scarcity but on its ability to register uncoerced decisions among self-sovereigns on the basis of equality. Initially the ''vote'' token might be able to compete with pollsters and any other rudimentary simulations that aim to predict elections, but eventually it can become a sovereign system on its own right as citizenship migrates online. ''Votes'' operate as a signal able to register events recorded on an incorruptible blockchain that stores political history that cannot be erased or modified in any way. Future generations get exposed to their past without intermediaries.

===3.4 Value===

We take three approaches to define the value of the ''vote'' token:

* '''Status-Quo''': Social media offers a clear reference on how ''likes'' get valued online.
* '''Work & Time''': A ''Universal Basic Income'' perspective offers useful insights on how labour time is being valued.
* '''Nation-States''': Traditional elections offer useful insights on how votes are valued today.

With those references, we then discuss the divisibility of the ''vote'' token and its implementation to govern a Democracy Support Fund.

====3.4.1 Status-Quo====

A comparative benchmark for the value of the ''vote'' token can be found on the Facebook network currently valuing 2 billion users with a market capitalization of ~$500 billion averaging an estimate of '''$250 per user'''. Democracy Earth Foundation regards Facebook's ''like'' function analogous to using ''votes'' in an open network. It is hard to estimate the quantity of ''likes'' made on this platform since it's private information and raw estimates project ''likes'' happening in the amount of trillions on a daily basis.

Marketers that operate the Facebook advertising machine price ''likes'' in a range that can go from '''$0.10 to as high as $25''' based on the reputation and popularity of the account being used to capture user attention. In this sense, we believe this price reference is relevant for end-users in order to empower them with a token that can be competitive with leading social media platforms. But it must be noted that unlike ''likes'', ''votes'' directly empower holders with the right to participate in any financial benefit that can be connected to their use without intermediation. With ''votes'', profiting from user data will no longer be the exclusive domain of the Facebook middleman but instead will be enabled by a native token generation mechanism that is based on the principles established by the [http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/ Universal Declaration of Human Rights]:

<blockquote>
  Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association. Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives.
</blockquote>

With the creation of Sovereign as an interface for blockchain-based democracies operating with ''vote'' tokens, Democracy Earth Foundation's aim is to deliver a ''Linux moment'' to Facebook: analogous to the rise of open source operating systems in the early 1990's, Linux became an alternative to the monopolizing force of Microsoft's Windows that dominated the market of personal computers and internet servers. A free and open Internet must pursue the creation of a social network where no single entity can excercise algorithmic control of the shared ideas in exchange for the private information of its users. And while Facebook mines user attention for profit, the Democracy Earth network will use the same resource to strengthen the trust of the ''vote'' token with its ''Proof of Identity'' process. As we acknowledge the growing political influence social media already has in the world, the urgency of laying out an open social network that is uncensorable, sovereign and free becomes pressing.

====3.4.2 Work & Time====

Coming from a ''Universal Basic Income'' perspective, a useful reference that values time and labour is the proposed [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States minimum wage in the US] based on federal, state and local laws across the country. As of July 2016 it has been set at '''$7.25 per hour'''.

[[File:/images/minimum-wage-us.png|Minimum wage in the US.]]

For the ''vote'' token to effectively become a useful network able to index UBI on a global scale, an expectation regarding its pricing dynamic must be set at 1 ''vote'' unit as equivalent to 1 hour of work. Hence this anchors the initial price of the token at:

  1 vote = $ 7.25

As long as the network successfully bans ''replicants'' and rewards validated self-sovereign identities indexed on the Bitcoin blockchain, then any UBI initiative can trust the present data to allocate resources without the risk of abuse.

====3.4.3 Nation-States====

From a Nation-State perspective, a useful reference can be found in the cost for implementing national elections. The 2016 Presidential Race in the United States had a total cost as high as [https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/cost.php $ 2,386,733,696]. Even though it had the lowest voter turnout in 20 years, an estimated total of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_the_United_States_presidential_elections ~138,847,000 voters] participated. Hence, a simple calculation can price the vote token issued by the US government for this electoral process at '''$ 17.18 per vote'''. On the other end of the spectrum, developing nations like Argentina offer a similar reference: their 2017 legislative election had an estimated cost of [http://www.lanacion.com.ar/2034493-las-paso-costaran-2800-millones-pero-casi-no-definiran-candidatos $ 164,705,882] with a total of [http://www.elintransigente.com/politica/2017/8/13/cuantos-argentinos-votaron-paso-449552.html ~24,500,000 voters], setting the price at '''$ 6.70 per vote'''. It is within that range of value that Nation-States invest resources to guarantee voting rights to all its citizens.

[[File:/images/cost-of-us-elections.png|Cost of US Elections.]]

According to Facebook's seed investor Peter Thiel, a rule of thumb for technological innovation is that in order to beat a precedent paradigm, an innovation must outperform the task of the previous way of doing things [http://zerotoonebook.com/ by at least a factor of 10] in terms of cost and utility. For example: the digital word processor became successful because it does what a typewriter did in a way that can be considered at least ten times better and ten times cheaper. The same applies to fax in contrast to the postal service; and e-mail in contrast to fax. Hence the transition from traditional voting to a new standard of blockchain based voting should work on the same basis.

A simple comparison shows the strict limitations electoral votes have in comparison with the ''vote'' token proposed on this paper:

* '''Expensive Security''': Nation-State's ''Proof of Identity'' demands several resources to identify citizens during many stages of their life. Birth certificates, passports, driver's license, national ID cards, social security, wedding certificates, death certificates are all aimed at keeping the public record of citizens up to date. This is the leading function of the State and it can lead to persecutory behaviour.
* '''Limited Utility''': Once a citizen casts a vote during an election, it cannot be modified until 4 to 6 years later when the elected positions get renovated. Only those among the elected positions (i.e. senators and congressmen) get the right to spend more votes than the rest of the citizens.
* '''Reduced Bandwidth''': Citizens get to choose from a handful of options only once every 2 or 4 years. If we consider each option as a bit on the system then traditional elections can be regarded as ''8 bit democracies'', such is the current bandwidth for participation under most governments.

In order to maintain the reference price set at the minimum wage in the US while being able to be at least ~10X more efficient than any traditional election, ''vote'' utility must be extended by making the token divisible.

====3.4.4 Divisibility====

The waiting period of 250 blocks for every new dripped ''vote'' limits the perceived gratification delivered by the system to every ~42 hours. This constraint is set in order to tie the economic logic of the ''vote'' token to its capacity of indexing all the successful ''Proof of Identities'' to a ''Universal Basic Income'' dripping dynamic. But the ability to begin interacting with the system itself shouldn't require a long waiting period: by introducing decimal positions, the network can offer instant gratification by adapting the dripping dynamic down to a minimum fraction of human attention.

Considering that,

  1 vote = 250 blocks = 2,500 minutes = 150,000 seconds

To keep the shortest possible decimal extension while adapting the dripping rate to the minimum span of human attention, the ''vote'' network should perform a revolution every 15 seconds:

  15 seconds = 0.0001 votes

In the same way the minimum fraction of a Bitcoin is branded as 1 satoshi (i.e. 100,000,000 satoshis = 1 bitcoin), we consider it is suitable to brand the minimum fraction of a ''vote'' as a ''revolution'' since this concept helps to express the speed at which the network grants political rights,

  1 vote = 10,000 revolutions

Which can also be expressed as,

  1 revolution = 0.0001 votes

By allowing 4 decimal positions in the token, a ''revolution'' gets dripped to a valid ''Proof of Identity'' in the network every 15 seconds. ''Revolutions'' bring almost instant access to political rights while keeping the same utility capacity as ''votes'' with a cost that is comparatively 10,000X more efficient than Nation-State elections:

  1 revolution = 0.0001 votes = $ 0.000725

For the identification of the token in third party applications, we suggest the ''VOTE'' and ''VOT'' tickers.

After all [https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them]. Digital technology has proven to possess a greater capacity in the reach and quality of its messaging abilities and as new generations grow connected under a global commons, information architectures will regulate our political and financial relations without the physical restrictions of the past. The undeniable success of the Bitcoin experiment consistently beating even the most radical forecasts throughout a decade speaks greatly about the unleashed potential humanity has found. The status-quo will always speak from a skeptical position since halting progress can only come from a position of comfort. But just as the Internet didn't wait for the adaptation of age-old empires, blockchains won't care for political promises: a technologically advanced society can enter agreements of mutual cooperation without falling back to the means of coercion and violence. Such is the remarkable consequence of disintermediation of trust without boundaries, a reality that won't emerge in a single isolated part of a country or region of the globe, but will be distributed across the entire planet. The ''next Silicon Valley'' is not in a far away land or on any land at all, but a new frontier of the internet itself rising as the one true open, free and sovereign network of peers.

 @timothy.high ví esse link que pode te interessar https://www.nexojornal.com.br/expresso/2017/11/21/Como-funciona-a-rede-social-que-quer-organizar-o-debate-na-internet

Timothy High [10:47 PM]
@paulaberman thanks for the tip!
I’m looking at the site right now
it’s already a lot closer to what I was imagining than anything I’ve seen before

and I’m really impressed at their topology graph


[10:50]
this is a view I hadn’t imagined:
https://democracyearth.slack.com/files/U3Z715L02/F873NMMV4/screenshot_2017-11-27_22.50.19.png

Timothy High [10:53 PM]
There are a LOT of interesting features already here


Timothy High [10:56 PM]
this view especially is intense, although not sure how useful it is:
https://democracyearth.slack.com/files/U3Z715L02/F85HHSQRE/screenshot_2017-11-27_22.56.05.png

Timothy High [10:57 PM]
Wow, they’re in Brooklyn, not too far from my company’s home office


[10:59]
It looks like they’ve only been around since August?


[10:59]
Released, at least


[10:59]
So, the negatives:


[10:59]
1) Only one REAL negative: it’s a private company with a CEO

[11:03]
I’ll pin to the top of this channel a discussion of what this whole thing is about, but basically a fundamental concept behind making THE debate site is that “you never have to repeat an argument"

[11:04] 
that is, public discussion never seems to go anywhere because claims and counterclaims are made over and over again between different parties, and the amount of information is never consistent.


[11:06] 
our knowledge doesn’t ACCUMULATE - instead, we handle debates like they’re some kind of game of “telephone”, where each person repeats what they heard to the next person, but with less context, less information, and only some of the original arguments


[11:06] 
In order to end this style of debate, we need one central, CANONICAL source for claims and arguments


[11:08] 
then, when someone makes an offhanded comment in Twitter or FB, (like “A UBI could eliminate competition and thus diminish progress in a variety of areas”) instead of it being superficial, you would know it was backed by all the data the world could provide up to now.

[11:10] 
So, getting back to the first negative of Kialo, it would be WAY too risky in many many ways to place the one canonical location for debates in the hands of a private corporation.


[11:10] 
What are the alternatives that I have considered?


[11:11] 
1a) A Wikipedia-like foundation that guarantees an open source technology underlying a creative commons-type license, with a complete, traceable history of all modifications


[11:11] 
1b) Blockchain


[11:12] 
The problem with Blockchain is that, until someone can convince me otherwise (maybe through sharding, for example), it’s just way too slow and bulky


[11:12] 
(wait to you hear how complicated moderation can be…)


[11:14] 
2) This is actually related to the first issue, but: How can anyone fully trust a company that needs to make money to host THE site that holds all our political opinions

[11:14] 
I thought about launching this idea as a private company at one point (a guy’s gotta pay bills, right?), and came to a horrifying conclusion:

[11:16] 
we’re already afraid that Facebook has too much power, and all we give it are likes


[11:17] 
imagine a private company where we cast actual votes and contribute arguments to a central debate that affects humanity. How much could you sell that for?


[11:18] 
Worse, how long until someone starts accusing the company of weighting the odds in favor of one candidate over another? Of promoting the debates it thinks are important over the others? And so on. And who’s to say the accusations are wrong??


[11:20] 
3) Now a quick list of features they seem to be missing from my concept (which is by no means a criticism - they only just launched, and I am impressed!)


[11:21] 
- Context: their context seems to be limited to that of a debate. The problem is, the results of a debate can change just with subtle context switches


[11:25] 
ex: 
The crime rate in communities of illegal immigrants is higher than the average (hard to conclude such a broad claim)
The crime rate in communities of illegal immigrants in the U.S. is higher than the average (still full of subtleties)
The crime rate in communities of illegal immigrants in the U.S. in the 21st century is higher than the average (getting closer to something you could prove)
The crime rate in communities of illegal immigrants in the U.S. in the 21st century is higher than the average for communities of similar socio-economic status (statistically shown to not be true by most analyses)
The crime rate in communities of illegal Somali immigrants in the U.S. in the 21st century is higher than the average for communities of similar socio-economic status (actually true - although I think it was for legal immigrants of refugee status, but just to complete the example…)


[11:27] 
So, at some point, there needs to be a way to attach contexts (immigrants, 21st century, United States, Somali refugees, crime (what kind??)) to a debate.


[11:27] 
Also, a way to “clone” a debate in order to create variations based on changing contexts

[11:31] 
I’ve been thinking about this, and realized that machine learning could help a lot with assigning contexts automatically based on content, but would still require human curation

[11:32] 
Also, something like the Google Knowledge Graph, or Wikidata could be the source for contexts

[11:33] 

Pat Harrington [11:50 PM] 
yeah, so there should definitely be a place for debates in Democracy Earth and the UX will be complex but important (people may already be working on this). The notion of repeating a debate is really interesting. How do you have thousands of people understand and inform debates without repeating prior arguments? And debates are never finished. As we learn more information, we should return to certain debates and update our position based on new knowledge.

From a design perspective, it would be really hard to get all this right the first time. So I would suggest “prototyping it” by building a simple debating tool and handing it to small groups of people to use. Then ask them what’s missing and how it can be improved (by design and by technology).

Agreed!


[11:54] 
So, the site that @paulaberman showed me today turns out to be a GREAT prototype starting point, that’s already working


[11:54] 
https://www.kialo.com

I’m using that basically as a jumping-off point for what I think the next steps would be


[11:55] 
>And debates are never finished. As we learn more information, we should return to certain debates and update our position based on new knowledge.


[11:55] 
Right. My underlying belief is that debates are never really over


[11:56] 
but they sloooooow down as we run out of new information (assuming we are able to stop people from repeating the same arguments)


[11:56] 
This means, also, that there’s no final answer… just an evolution towards some kind of equilibrium (that new data may disturb)


[11:57] 
that’s not to say you can’t make a decision - you need to draw a line somewhere and just decide


[11:57] 
but what’s interesting is that decisions can be revisited if the debate changes


[11:58] 
for example: “let’s remove this regulation. It should stimulate the economy, and shouldn’t in practice be worse for the environment"


[11:58]
if in 3 years, that turns out to be totally wrong, it may change the debate, and lead to a new vote

Timothy High [12:05 AM]
More missing features:


[12:06]
- Scores of “truth” (on claims) and “relevance” on arguments


[12:06]
Actually, let me back that up a bit…


[12:06]
- Claims vs. Arguments


[12:07]
In my conception of a canonical debate, you make claims (as they have). But while claims can be debated, they stand on their own


[12:07]
An ARGUMENT is a claim used in a debate for another claim


[12:09]
So, let me take another example from Kialo (thanks again @paulaberman! Now I don’t have to come up with examples on my own!)

https://www.kialo.com/eating-meat-is-wrong-1229/1229.0=1229.1/=1229.1
Kialo
Eating Meat is Wrong
The ethics of eating meat has been long debating by philosophers, activists, and religious leaders. Today, in the West at least, vegetarianism and veganism is… (81 kB)

The top “claim” here is “Humans should stop eating meat"


[12:10] 
Sounds debatable, right?


[12:10] 
What’s the first pro argument?


[12:10] 
https://www.kialo.com/eating-meat-is-wrong-1229/1229.0=1229.1+1229.2074
Kialo

Eating and producing meat heavily contributes to climate change. (81 kB)
May 20th, 2016 at 2:21 AM


That right there is another “claim” (true/false) that can be debated


[12:11] 
But it’s also an argument being used to support the other claim


[12:11] 
There are two parts to whether or not it’s a good argument:


[12:12] 
- Is it true? (or, do you agree?)


[12:12] 
- Is it relevant, and is it important?


Here’s a con argument that shows the point better:


[12:13] 
https://www.kialo.com/eating-meat-is-wrong-1229/1229.0=1229.1-1229.12
Kialo
Ceasing to eat meat would harm the economy.
Ceasing to eat meat would harm the economy. (81 kB)

Is that true?


We have an argument that says yes it is:


[12:16] 
https://www.kialo.com/eating-meat-is-wrong-1229/1229.0=1229.1-1229.12+1229.1248
Kialo
Livestock production accounts for 1.4% of the world’s total…
Livestock production accounts for 1.4% of the world’s total GDP. The production and sale of animal products account for 1.3 billion people’s jobs, and 987… (81 kB)

That’s a “truth” argument


Timothy High 
[12:22 AM] 
there should be a score for “how true” it is


[12:22] 
there should also be a score for “how relevant” it is


[12:23] 
if it’s 1.4% of the worlds GDP, that’s MORE impactful than 0.5%, and LESS than 3%, and that should be reflects


[12:24] 
This argument here is actually a “relevance” argument - because, yes!, the relevance of an argument is debatable:


[12:24] 
https://www.kialo.com/eating-meat-is-wrong-1229/1229.0=1229.1-1229.12-1229.2368
Kialo
Whether or not something is good for the economy does not…
Whether or not something is good for the economy does not impact whether it is morally acceptable. (81 kB)

However, here’s my point: in order for debates to be canonical and reusable, you need to be able to separate the CLAIM (which is just about whether or not it’s true) from its use as an ARGUMENT (the meat industry suffering from total vegetarianism may be true, but make no difference if you’re debating whether or not Donald Trump is a jerk…)


Timothy High 
[12:31 AM] 
Now, let’s invert this… we’ve been debating whether or not humans should stop eating meat.


[12:31] 
What is that? A claim. A standalone claim. Not an argument itself.


[12:31] 
But, let’s say it’s “winning” (60% in agreement…)

[12:31] 
you could go ahead and use that as an ARGUMENT in a debate of another claim:


[12:33] 
“We should put a moritorium on all expansion of ranch lands meant for the purpose of raising animals for human consumption"


[12:33]
Get it? A claim, debatable on its own rights, can be applied in a debate on another claim. AND, that application (i.e. argument) can be debated in terms of relevance and impact


[12:35]
- Roll up of scores


[12:35]
You should be able to see which side of any debate is “winning” and by how much… but this is more complicated than you think!


[12:36]
A good argument made on shaky foundations is itself a shaky argument to make

[12:38]
In other words, a claim that is supported by untruthful and/or irrelevant claims should itself not be considered 100% truthful. And if it, in turn, is used as an argument, the claim it is supporting should only gain support relative to the strength of that original claim.

[12:38]
Scores should “roll up” from bottom to top, giving a very simple summary view of the claim at the top (edited)


[12:39]
- Beliefs


[12:39]
But.. wait! Just because other people don’t agree with me, that doesn’t me I don’t have a right to my own opinion.

[12:41]
What if 80% of the world agrees that humans should not eat meat, but I think it’s perfectly fine?

[12:41]
How does that affect the ranch land expansion moritorium debate for ME?

[12:42]
There should be at least 3 ways to view any debate:

[12:42]
1) The consensus view (the average scores as voted by everyone who cared to vote, all rolled up)

[12:44]
2) MY view - you should be able to declare your “beliefs” (that is, your opinion on the truthfulness of each claim), and see how the top-level claim shapes up according to your world view

[12:45]
3) Hypothetical views - it should be possible to see what a debate would look like IF YOU BELIEVED something you didn’t actually state is your belief

[12:48]
e.g. What if I believed in Classical Economic theory instead of a Keynesian viewpoint? How would that change everything?

[12:49]
One of the main goals of debating (once all the facts are out in the open!) is to understand what makes someone else think differently from you.

[12:49]
This would be an INCREDIBLE tool for understanding one another

[12:49]
(hint, by the way: the answer is beliefs, and trade offs in values - which is something I’ll go into another time)

Timothy High [1:04 AM]
- Curation

[1:05]
I’m sure they have something on their back end, but we don’t get to see it.

[1:05]
The curation component needs to do some REALLY COMPLEX stuff:


[1:05]
— Merge/de-dupe arguments and claims


[1:06]
How do you keep it from getting messy? You need to take two identical but differently-worded items and merge them into one. But what happens to their supporting arguments? And to the votes on those arguments?


[1:07]
— Split claims


[1:08]
“Eating meat is really bad for you, and also those cows are soooo cute!"


[1:09] 
Well, those are actually two separate claims, so they should be broken up. What happens to THEIR arguments and scores?? (don’t forget context!)


[1:09] 
— Rearrange

This argument in Kialo is interesting:


[1:13] 
https://www.kialo.com/eating-meat-is-wrong-1229/1229.0=1229.1-1229.12-1229.2624
Kialo
Harvesting human organs and reselling them would be good for…
Harvesting human organs and reselling them would be good for the economy. This does not make it morally acceptable, and this debate centres around the morals… (81 kB)



What’s going on there? You actually have a disagreement about what they’re even debating (this happens SO OFTEN in live Oxford-style debates)


[1:14] 
because the title says “Eating meat is wrong”, but the topology says the topic of the debate is “Humans should stop eating meat”, you have a confusion of arguments


[1:14] 
How could we solve that problem?


[1:15] 
You create a new claim: “Eating meat is immoral"


[1:15]
You then move ALL arguments about morality under that topic


[1:15]
then you use that new claim as an argument in favor of “Humans should stop eating meat"


[1:16] 
That’s what curation is about - making sense of a jumble of public thoughts on the topic, and putting them where they need to go


Timothy High 
[10:32 AM] 
Hi all again! Sorry this is such a brain dump for me… I’ve been thinking about about this a loooooooong time


Timothy High [10:35 AM] 
More things that the debate platform should provide:


[10:35] 
- Anonymous voting


[10:35] 
Looks like Kialo does that


[10:36] 
- Open to everyone


[10:36] 
Kialo allows this, too


[10:36] 
- Protection against Sybil attacks


[10:36] 
This is something necessary to preserve the authenticity of the debates. Unfortunately, Kialo does not do this.


[10:37] 
The PoI component of Sovereign, however, would, within reason


[10:37] 
- Evidence


[10:38] 
Evidence is something LIKE a claim, but different


[10:38] 
--> It can be debated as to whether or not it is “true” (actually, authentic!)


[10:39] 
--> It can be used as a supporting argument, and have its relevance and impact debated just like any other argument


[10:40] 
--> It would have an extra attribute: PROVENANCE, the source of that evidence. Provenance is critical in submitting evidence in a court of law. So should it be in a debate


[10:40] 
It makes a huge difference, for example, which news outlet is submitting a story.


[10:41] 
It makes a difference if we’re talking about something Donald Trump said about his foreign policy vs. anyone else in his cabinet (who seem to often have a different policy…)


[10:42] 
CRITICAL in this day and age, people now cast doubt not only on reported news, but on original quotes, photos and videos. The fact is it is getting easier and easier to fabricate digital evidence.


[10:44] 
Fortunately, technology is already coming to the rescue vis-a-vis Blockchain technologies and digital hashes. Hopefully at some point in the near future, it will be possible to validate if a video is from the original source, or if it has been altered (Snapchat shows us, however, that even “original” content can be altered at the time of creation - perhaps in the future, even the hardware and software used for a recording will need to be part of its provenance…)


[10:45] 
PHILOSOPHIES:


[10:45] 
I’ll just throw these out there for now

* Debates should be canonical. 
This facilitates gathering all the information in one place. 
It also avoids the problems of repeating the debate with only partial information elsewhere. 
Lastly, it empowers people with the power to make their point without having to rely only on what’s in their head. I’ve tried to debate gun control many times, but generally it’s with people that are much more passionate, and informed about the issue than I. It’s an imbalanced exchange.


[10:48] 
* A debate should be separated from the ones debating
How often have we watched a debate, political, Oxford-style, or otherwise, and picked a “winner” based mostly on WHO made the best arguments?


[10:49] 
That’s NOT a great way to make important decisions. It’s a great way for motivating and hitting emotional chords, but it’s only part of the whole story.


[10:50] 
* Emotions are for motivating. Logic is for making decisions.


Nelson Cardozo 
[10:50 AM] 
joined #paper_agora.


Timothy High [10:51 AM] 
The emotional component of a debate SHOULD NOT be stripped from the debate. BUT it should be used to motivate people to participate, not to make a final decision.


[10:51] 
* Debates are not “won"


[10:52]
Too often we talk about who “won” a debate. The NPR show Intelligence Squared chooses a winning side based on which one was better able sway the opinion of the audience more. Political debates result in discussions about who won, both by gaining votes, and by seeming more “presidential” or “confident”.


[10:53]
That attitude actually serves to drive a wedge between people.


Timothy High [10:54 AM]
Debate should REALLY be about learning. Learning about he topic. Learning about the trade-offs. Learning about how your family, or your friends or neighbors feel and think about an issue. Learning not to demonize those that disagree with you, but rather to understand it’s a difference in values (usually rather noble ones).

Nelson Cardozo [1 day ago]
About this, I think politics.stackexchange.com is a great example of that. In this, avoid emotional arguments is crucial to make a good point.

Timothy High [10:55 AM]
* Debates are the one natural place we have that brings opposites together

Timothy High [10:57 AM]
In this age, we are terribly worried about the “information bubbles” that we, google and Facebook are creating around us. As they seek to serve us the information we most “like’, and we choose to like the things that most agree with us, it has been demonstrated that we’ve created our own isolated groups.


[10:57]
(There’s a lot of talk  about this in the Sovereign white paper, as well)


[10:58]
People are asking FB and Google to change their BUSINESS model in order to force us to eat our vegetables and see news that’s good for us.


[10:58]
We can try to force it, but it’s working against natural incentives.


[10:59]
Debate creates a natural opportunity to see the other side while trying to make your own points.


[10:59]
* It should be possible to grasp the essence of a debate on all sides in under 30 seconds.


[11:00]
We are used to reading tweets, and only looking at the headlines of articles. We are becoming lazy and information-poor. The debate should be able to accommodate that laziness while providing the ability to drill down into it as much as necessary.


[11:01]
Kialo does this pretty well, along my lines of thinking.


[11:02]
The point is that the problem with tweets and headlines is not their brevity, but their lack of support a reliability.


[11:04]
If I tweet that “Liz Warren is a liar because she said she’s an Indian” it sounds like flamebait

Timothy High [11:04 AM]
but if I send that same statement out as an argument backed by dozens of arguments and evidence, you will know right away what I’m saying (and whether or not to agree)


[11:05]
* There is no “right” answer


[11:05]
There’s just getting closer to the truth as best we can.

[11:06]
In a decision, there’s also figuring out what the trade offs are, and making your choice between them.


[11:06]
Debates can be as logical as we can make them. But a machine can never decide for us.

Timothy High
[11:30 AM]
* A canonical debate is essential for direct democracy
Up to this point in history, democratic decisions have been made based on incomplete information.


[11:32]
It is no wonder decisions about who should lead the most powerful nation in the world sometimes come down to relatively irrelevant but emotional issues like gay marriage and abortion


[11:33]
people are asked to decide on to many extremely complex issues at once with to little real information


[11:35]
worse, these days, the issues that affect us the most, local elections, have so little information readily available that many voters don't even recognize the candidates.

[11:35]
* If you build it, they MUST come


[11:37]
if we are ever successful at hosting a truly canonical debate (think Wikipedia - level success) there will be no place for the liars and cheaters to hide


[11:39]
Let Breitbart try and make absurd claims off-debate. the first thing that will happen is someone else will submit the article as "evidence" and see it get destroyed in public


[11:40]
once Breitbart, or MSNBC, etc. starts appearing there, their followers will have no choice but to recognize the importance of the debate contents


[11:41]
* A canonical debate changes the incentives of news sources


[11:43]
so far in the internet era, the incentive seems to be on the creation of sensationalist news and "clickbait" in order to make money off views


[11:45]
once reporting itself can be constructively debated, reputations will be on the line, and false claims easily refuted


Timothy High [11:51 AM]
The canonical debate will become a place which drives traffic out to news sources - those with the best original investigative reporting (via “evidence”), the best fact-checking, and the best fact-based opinion papers and stories that can tie it all together in a thoughtful way.


[11:51]
No more running around calling something “FAKE news!”  - the proof is in the pudding.

Pat Harrington [9:32 PM]
@timothy.high great brain dump! A lot of good content here. Do you have any suggestions on what the next steps are? i.e. get a group of us to use kialo? What do we need to build to start doing this?


Timothy High [9:56 PM]
Great question! Anyone who is interested, please try out Kialo to get a feel for how logical debates can break down, and what can be improved

I _started_ work on a prototype


[9:57]
actually, two, but one was so long ago, I don’t think it’s worth reviving it


[9:57]
@Bruno Sato was helping me with the 2nd generation


[9:57]
but we stopped when I got tied up in too many other things


[9:58]
here’s the Golang-based server-side repository in Github for that:

https://github.com/bigokro/gruff-server

Here’s the web side:


[9:59]
https://github.com/bigokro/gruff-web

So, there’s a lot of work to be done


[10:00]
1) White paper


[10:01]
I need to write up a white paper for this, like the main one in #paper


[10:01]
That will mean open discussions about the ideas above, and then writing it up


[10:01]
ANYONE can help with that, at any time


[10:02]
2) Medium article


[10:02]
My responsibility, I think. It can be more than one, but I’ve been asked to publish some for the DEF blog. Any suggestions for topics would be great - some subset of the things I mentioned above


[10:03]
I didn’t post these here - only in private DMs, so I’ll go ahead here: I’ve already written some other Medium posts on this subject.

Anyone who’s interested can give these a read. I need to do the next iteration of these for the blog


[10:08]
3) Trello?


[10:08]
Some place to organize tasks for people to help

It would be great if we could build a quick prototype (any developers interested? I can do a quick UX mock up based off of Kialo) and link it to any Medium posts related to this concept. Could be something simple like start a debate, and watch how people use it.


Timothy High [10:10 PM]
4) UX people: it would be fantastic to hear ideas on how to make this work for users


[10:10]
given all the complexity, it’s a major challenge


[10:11]
@Pat Harrington any UX mock ups would make for great Medium posts to discuss our work


[10:11]
as for quick prototypes, I think the bar has been raised quite a bit by Kialo


[10:11]
Kialo is already the “quick prototype” now


[10:12]
what would be interesting is to work on the ideas that go beyond Kialo


[10:12]
but either way, that takes us to:


Bruno Sato [10:13 PM]
I can make prototype in sketch with base on this conversation


Timothy High [10:13 PM]
5) Server-side and Client-side developers: if you’re interested, you could already get started on work with the current versions of gruff-server and gruff-web


Bruno Sato [10:14 PM]
gruff-web is made with vue.js


Timothy High [10:14 PM]
We could use by github projects for this, and track issues in the github repo itself


[10:15]
6) Blockchain experts: we need to work out the interfaces with Sovereign, as well as discuss whether or not this project should be an “oracle”, or if the whole thing should be on the blockchain (and which blockchain)


[10:16]
7) Anyone who is an expert in logical argumentation, I’d love to hear your takes on the data model

[10:17]
8 ) Machine learning / natural language experts / topology experts (edited)


[10:17]
SOOOOOO much good stuff for you guys here!


[10:18]
- A web crawler to seek out and deconstruct debates and add any content you can find to the platform


[10:18]
- Automatic determination of “context” from the text and context of claims


[10:19]
- Decide what will be our official reference for context: WikiData, Google Knowledge Graph, our own tagging system…


[10:19]
- Recommendation engines based on context


[10:21]
9) Subject matter experts: try out the platform (when ready for experimentation) by filling it with content. Even better, invite your “opponents” to join in

[10:22]
10) Publicists, marketers, or anyone that would like to do any sort of outreach: let people know about the project, and get people to join in

[10:23]
I guess I need to deploy the current version on a server somewhere so people can start to play around with it
